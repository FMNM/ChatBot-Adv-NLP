      "Dealing with anxiety effectively requires a multi-pronged approach that combines self-help strategies with professional support. Here's what the provided context suggests:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Seek Professional Help:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Therapy:**  It's highly recommended to see a therapist specializing in anxiety disorders. They can help you identify underlying causes, develop personalized coping strategies, and guide you through exposure therapy.\n",
      "* **Finding the Right Therapist:** It's crucial to feel comfortable with your therapist as a trusting relationship is essential for effective treatment. \n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Mindfulness and Self-Care:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Daily Mindfulness Practice:**  Engage in activities like guided meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga to cultivate a sense of calmness and present-moment awareness.\n",
      "* **Positive Self-Talk:**  Challenge negative thoughts and replace them with more optimistic and reassuring self-statements.\n",
      "* **Exposure Therapy:**  Gradually confront anxiety-provoking situations under the guidance of a therapist. This helps desensitize you to triggers and builds confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Embrace Acceptance:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT):**  This approach encourages acceptance of difficult emotions, including anxiety. It emphasizes focusing on values and taking actions aligned with what matters most.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Practical Tools:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Distraction Techniques:** Engage your mind in activities like listening to audiobooks, counting backwards, or naming cities to shift your focus away from anxious thoughts.\n",
      "* **Sensory Regulation:**  Use cold packs or ice to help calm down and regulate your body's temperature.\n",
      "* **Soothing Self-Talk:**  Use phrases like \"I can handle this\" or \"I've been through this before\" to reassure yourself and manage fear.\n",
      "* **Diaphragmatic Breathing:**  Practice deep abdominal breathing regularly to calm your nervous system. \n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Healthy Lifestyle:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Exercise:** Regular physical activity can help manage anxiety and improve mood.\n",
      "* **Diet and Sleep:**  Maintain a balanced diet and get enough sleep to support overall well-being.\n",

To decrease your anxiety symptoms it ’ s recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable with.In my practice I educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety:1 .

Understand your negative and positive thoughts . Many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen . Increase positive self-talk when feeling down or when anxious . For example : `` I do n't need to worry , I am calm and relaxed '' . 3 . Exposure to fearful or anxious situations . This can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional . Many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure . This may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do . For example : leaving the house ; presenting in front of others ; going to social events ; and having conversations with people . However , the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills ( ex . deep breathing ) the chances of anxiety will decrease . I hope this was helpful .

People keep telling me I have `` anxiety '' and I 'm terrified of having an anxiety attack on the road . This is all new to me . What can I do ? Response : Anxiety or panic attacks can be very frightening . Here are a few `` tools '' you can use that will help in the short term : Keeping your mind occupied by listening to books on tape may help ; Counting backwards from 100 in 7 's ; Naming cities that begin with each letter of the alphabet ; Keeping some ice or an ice pack in a cooler beside you , which you may take out and hold in your hand or to your face ; Soothing self-talk such as `` This is uncomfortable , but I can handle it '' or `` I 've been through this before and can make it through again '' . I recommend that you seek out a Therapist to help you with some long-term solutions to the anxiety . Additionally , learning to breathe into the abdomen and practicing this daily is another long-term solution . Yoga and meditation would be great !\n",
