# ChatBot-Adv-NLP

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based chatbot developed for the 'Advanced Natural Language Processing' course at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). The chatbot leverages state-of-the-art NLP techniques to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses by combining retrieval-based and generative models. It aims to enhance user interaction by retrieving pertinent information from a large corpus and generating coherent and context-aware replies.
