1,"What is the main purpose of the Basel III regulatory framework, as implemented in Australia?","The Basel III capital reforms are international banking supervisors  response to deficiencies in the regulatory capital framework identified during the global financial crisis. These reforms were endorsed prior to release by the G20, of which Australia is a member. APRA, as a member of the Basel Committee, played an active role in formulating the Basel III measures. "
2,Can you explain the difference between an Australian Deposit-Taking Institution (DTI) and a Non-Deposit Taking Institution (NDTI)?,"An Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs) is an Australian government term for financial institutions in Australia which are supervised by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and authorised to accept deposits from the public.Whereas a non-deposit taking institution is a financial institution that does not have a full banking license or is not supervised by a national regulatory authority. These type of lenders are generally privately funded and do not have the normal features of a deposit taking institution (i.e. you cannot use an offset account as they have no facility to hold your funds). Generally it is the non-deposit taking institutions which will offer a non-conforming loan product. A non-conforming loan is a loan that fails to meet bank criteria for funding. This may include situations where the borrower has just started up a business and has a short trading history, has a poor credit history, or an ATO tax debt to be paid off."
3,How do Australian banks report their exposure to credit risk using the Internal Ratings-Based Approach (IRB)?,"IRB banks must compare regulatory expected losses (which are derived from their estimates of PD, LGD and EAD) against provisions held for credit losses and deduct any shortfall in provisions from the capital base. This leads to an increase in the capital requirement."
4,What is the definition of a Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) under Australian prudential regulations?,"The too-big-to-fail problem refers to the fact that certain financial institutions, because of their size and/or interconnectedness, could pose a material risk to financial stability and the real economy if they were to fail. Such institutions are referred to as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs)."
5,How do Australian banks calculate their Basel III capital requirements for Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital?,"The capital adequacy ratio is calculated by adding tier 1 capital to tier 2 capital and dividing by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the core capital of a bank, which includes equity capital and disclosed reserves. This type of capital absorbs losses without requiring the bank to cease its operations; tier 2 capital is used to absorb losses in the event of a liquidation.
Under Basel III, a banks tier 1 and tier 2 minimum capital adequacy ratio (including the capital conservation buffer) must be at least 10.5% of its risk-weighted assets (RWA). That combines the total capital requirement of 8% with the 2.5% capital conservation buffer. The capital conservation buffer recommendation is designed to build up banks capital, which they could use in periods of stress."
6,Can you explain the concept of Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under Australian prudential regulations?,The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) refers to the proportion of highly liquid assets that financial institutions must hold to ensure that they can meet their short-term obligations and ride out any disruptions in the market. It is mandated by international banking agreements known as the Basel Accords.
7,What are the key elements of a risk management framework under Australian banking regulations?,"An overarching risk management policy
An overview of the entity s approach to managing risk
Effective risk management frameworks generally describe the risk management processes to be used in the entity. This may include a common process for the assessment and management of individual risks including:
risk identification - how and when risks are identified,
risk assessment - how risks are assessed (likelihood, consequence, vulnerability, speed of onset etc), and
risk treatment - the entity s approach for treating risks (mitigate, share, transfer, accept etc).
Key risk management responsibilities
In line with element four of the Commonwealth Risk Management Policy, an entity s risk management framework should also clearly define the risk management responsibilities of officials, including the following:
Accountable Authority
Chief Risk Officer (if applicable)
Senior Executives
Audit Committee
Risk Committee (if applicable)
The risk management function
Risk owners
Control owners
Treatment owners
All staff
How the entity will report risks to both internal and external stakeholders
The attributes of the risk management culture that the entity seeks to develop
How the risk management framework and entity risk profile will be periodically reviewed and improved
The approach for measuring risk management performance
How the entity contributes to managing any shared or cross jurisdictional risks
An overview of the entity s approach to embedding risk management into its existing business processes"
8,How do Australian banks report their capital adequacy requirements to APRA?,"
Australian banks report their capital adequacy requirements to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) primarily through the quarterly and annual reporting of capital adequacy and risk-weighted assets (RWA) data. The APRA monitors this data as part of its prudential supervision to ensure banks maintain sufficient capital to absorb losses while protecting depositors and maintaining financial stability. Here s a breakdown of the reporting process:

Prudential Standard APS 110: APRA requires banks to meet capital adequacy standards set by the Prudential Standard APS 110 (Capital Adequacy), which aligns with the Basel III framework. This standard outlines minimum capital ratios banks must maintain, including the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios.

Regular Reporting Requirements:

Quarterly and Annual Reports: Banks submit detailed reports on their capital positions and risk exposures, which include the composition of capital, RWA, and calculations of their capital ratios.
Reporting Forms: These submissions are standardized through APRA s reporting forms (such as ARF 110.0 for capital adequacy and ARF 112.0 for RWA). Banks complete these forms using APRA s Data Collection Solution (D2A), and APRA recently transitioned to the APRA Connect system for enhanced data collection.
Disclosures and Stress Testing: APRA also requires larger banks to disclose their capital adequacy publicly, which increases transparency. They may also conduct periodic stress tests, where banks report on their capital adequacy under hypothetical stress scenarios to assess resilience.

Supervisory Review: APRA conducts supervisory reviews of these submissions to ensure compliance and may engage in direct discussions with banks to assess their capital positions and risk management practices.

This process allows APRA to monitor and enforce capital requirements while enabling it to act swiftly in response to financial risks affecting the banking system."
9,Can you explain the concept of Operational Risk under Australian prudential regulations?,"Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss (including to policy owners) resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events."
10,What is the definition of an Integrated Disclosure Framework (IDF) under Australian banking regulations?,"The integrated report is a concise communication about how an organisation s strategy, governance, performance and prospects, in the context of its external environment, lead to value creation over time. It drives high-quality corporate reporting and connectivity between financial statements and sustainability-related financial disclosures, and brings together information investors need to assess a company s ability to create value over time. An integrated report should be prepared in accordance with the Integrated Reporting Framework (IR Framework), which is an IFRS Foundation resource.
"
11,How do Australian banks report their exposure to liquidity risk using the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)?,"Australian banks report their exposure to liquidity risk through the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under APRA s Prudential Standard APS 210 (Liquidity). The LCR is designed to ensure banks maintain adequate levels of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to withstand a 30-day liquidity stress scenario. Here s an overview of how the reporting works:

1. **Prudential Standard APS 210**: The LCR requirement is part of APRA s APS 210, which outlines standards for liquidity risk management. This standard requires banks to maintain an LCR of at least 100%, meaning they should hold enough HQLA to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period.

2. **Monthly Reporting**:
   - **APRA s Reporting Forms**: Banks report their LCR metrics monthly to APRA using specific forms like ARF 210.1A, which captures details on HQLA holdings, cash outflows, and inflows.
   - **Calculation of the LCR**: Banks calculate their LCR by dividing the total value of HQLA by net cash outflows expected over a 30-day stress period. These net outflows include expected outflows minus expected inflows, as per APRA s defined parameters.

3. **Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures**:
   - **Quarterly Public Disclosures**: Large banks are required to publicly disclose their LCR on a quarterly basis, including a breakdown of HQLA and significant inflow/outflow categories. This transparency aims to boost market confidence in banks  liquidity positions.
   - **Additional Qualitative Information**: Banks often provide contextual information on liquidity risk management practices, including descriptions of the key drivers of their LCR ratios and any significant changes in the quarter.

4. **Daily Monitoring for Large Banks**: APRA requires large institutions to monitor their LCR on a daily basis. Although monthly reporting is standard, APRA may request daily data in times of financial stress for enhanced supervision.

5. **Stress Testing**: APRA conducts regular stress tests where banks are required to simulate liquidity stress scenarios and report how these would impact their LCR. These exercises help APRA assess the robustness of banks  liquidity management strategies.

This framework ensures Australian banks manage and report liquidity risk consistently, enabling APRA to monitor system-wide liquidity resilience and intervene if necessary."
12,Can you explain the concept of Credit Risk Management under Australian prudential regulations?,"Credit management is the process of deciding which customers to extend credit to and evaluating those customers creditworthiness over time. It involves setting credit limits for customers, monitoring customer payments and collections, and assessing the risks associated with extending credit to customers."
13,What are the key elements of a Capital Adequacy Framework under Australian banking regulations?,"Under Australian banking regulations, the Capital Adequacy Framework, governed by APRA, is designed to ensure banks maintain sufficient capital to absorb losses, support depositor protection, and promote financial stability. The key elements of this framework include:

1. **Minimum Capital Requirements**:
   - **Tiered Capital Ratios**: APRA requires banks to meet minimum capital ratios as outlined in Prudential Standard APS 110 (Capital Adequacy), consistent with the Basel III framework. These include:
     - **Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)**: The highest-quality capital, consisting mainly of common shares and retained earnings.
     - **Tier 1 Capital**: CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital instruments.
     - **Total Capital Ratio**: Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital, which includes subordinated debt and other forms of capital that can absorb losses.
   - **Capital Buffers**: Banks must maintain additional buffers above minimum ratios, including a **Capital Conservation Buffer** and, for larger banks, a **Countercyclical Capital Buffer** to protect against cyclical downturns.

2. **Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA)**:
   - Banks calculate their RWA based on the risk profile of their assets, where riskier assets receive higher weights. APRA requires banks to categorize their assets according to the level of credit, market, and operational risks they pose, which helps determine the capital needed to support these assets.

3. **Pillar 2 √ê Supervisory Review**:
   - APRA performs a **Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP)** under Pillar 2 to assess banks  internal capital adequacy and risk management processes. Based on its evaluation, APRA may impose additional capital requirements to cover risks specific to each institution beyond the Pillar 1 minimums.

4. **Pillar 3 √ê Market Discipline and Disclosure**:
   - Banks are required to disclose certain information regarding their capital adequacy and risk exposures on a regular basis under Pillar 3. These disclosures, which include capital ratios, RWA breakdowns, and descriptions of risk management practices, aim to increase transparency and market discipline by enabling stakeholders to assess a bank s risk and capital position.

5. **Stress Testing**:
   - APRA mandates regular stress testing as part of banks  internal capital adequacy assessments and also conducts industry-wide stress tests. These tests simulate adverse scenarios to evaluate the resilience of banks  capital positions and assess whether they hold sufficient capital to withstand economic shocks.

6. **Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)**:
   - Each bank must have an ICAAP, which is a structured framework for assessing capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile and operational strategy. The ICAAP, submitted annually to APRA, includes capital planning, risk measurement, and scenario analysis to ensure sufficient capital levels are maintained under varying economic conditions.

The Capital Adequacy Framework, with its requirements for minimum capital ratios, RWA calculations, supervisory review, disclosure, stress testing, and ICAAP, provides APRA with a comprehensive approach to overseeing the capital strength and resilience of Australian banks."
14,How do Australian banks calculate their risk-weighted assets (RWA) under Basel III?,"
Banks calculate risk-weighted assets by multiplying the exposure amount by the relevant risk weight for the type of loan or asset. A bank repeats this calculation for all of its loans and assets, and adds them together to calculate total credit risk-weighted assets."
15,Can you explain the concept of Systemic Risk under Australian prudential regulations?,Systemic risk is the risk of financial system disruption so widespread or severe that it causes material damage to the real economy. 
16,Can you explain the concept of Disclosures for the identification of potential G-SIBs under Australian prudential regulations?,"Every year, a sample of international banks must provide information to the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS) for assessment against a set of indicators that identify potential Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs)."
17,Can you explain the concept of Liquidity Risk under Australian prudential regulations?,"Liquidity risk is the possibility an institution will be unable to obtain funds, such as customer deposits or borrowed funds, at a reasonable price or within a necessary period to meet its financial obligations."
18,Who are High-Risk Customers?,"High-risk customers are individuals or entities that pose a greater risk to a business or financial institution due to different factors. These factors may include a higher likelihood of involvement in illegal activities, financial instability, or a history of behavior that could lead to financial losses for the institution.

Financial institutions are required to identify high-risk customers for several reasons. One of the most important reasons is compliance with AML requirements and regulations. But what is AML compliance?"
19,What is the meaning of credit risk mitigation?,"Credit risk mitigation is a process by which a company reduces its exposure to credit risks. It involves assessing creditworthiness, monitoring credit profiles, and managing risks to prevent revenue loss, ensuring a healthy balance sheet and cash flows."
20,Do Australian banks have to report their exposure to interest rate risk?,"The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) requires banks to summarise and report on the extent of interest rate risk that they face. For the banking book, this is measured as the expected change in economic value from a 200 basis point increase in interest rates at all maturities."
21,How do you calculate risk-weighted assets in RWA?,"Banks calculate risk-weighted assets by multiplying the exposure amount by the relevant risk weight for the type of loan or asset. A bank repeats this calculation for all of its loans and assets, and adds them together to calculate total credit risk-weighted assets."
22,What is an aps 310 audit?,APS 310/3PS 310 requires the appointed auditor to provide two different levels of assurance over the reliability of a specific set of ADI Reporting Forms at the ADIs financial year-end.
23,What is the audit and assurance policy statement?,An Audit and Assurance Policy (AAP) is intended to set out a companys approach to assuring the quality of the information it reports to shareholders (and other stakeholders) beyond that contained within the financial statements.
24,What is counterparty credit risk in derivatives?,Counterparty credit risk is the risk arising from the possibility that the counterparty may default on amounts owned on a derivative transaction.
25,What is concentration risk?,Concentration risk is the potential for a loss in value of an investment portfolio or a financial institution when an individual or group of exposures move together in an unfavorable direction. The implication of concentration risk is that it generates such a significant loss that recovery is unlikely.
26,What measures for the management of interest rate risk can be used by an Organisation?,"Gap analysis, duration analysis and stimulation models are interest rate risk measurement techniques. Each institution should use at least one, and preferably a combination of these techniques in managing its interest rate risk exposure."
27,How must banks assess and manage risks associated with outsourcing arrangements according to CPS 231?,All risks arising from outsourcing material business activities must be appropriately managed to ensure that the APRA-regulated entity is able to meet both its financial and service obligations to its depositors and/or policyholders. notify APRA after entering into agreements to outsource material business activities.
28,"What are the requirements for business continuity planning under CPS 232, and how must banks demonstrate resilience to operational disruptions?","Under CPS 232, an APRA-regulated entity must identify, assess, manage, mitigate and report on potential business continuity risks to ensure that it can meet its financial and service obligations."
29,What are the obligations for banks under CPS 234 regarding the protection of information assets and managing cyber security risks?,"Under CPS 234, APRA-regulated entities must implement information security controls to protect information assets, including those managed by related or third-parties, in a timely manner and commensurate with: Existing and emerging vulnerabilities and threats to critical and sensitive information assets."
30,What is the CPS 510 governance standard?,"This standard requires an entity to have a sound governance framework and to conduct its affairs with a high degree of integrity. Entities must meet specific requirements for board committees, appointments, renewal and performance. This is a core standard in the Governance Pillar."
31,What is a responsible person in APRA?,"Persons who are responsible for the management and oversight of an APRA-regulated entity need to have appropriate skills, experience and knowledge and act with honesty and integrity. These skills and qualities strengthen the protection afforded to depositors, policyholders and/or other stakeholders."
32,How must banks structure their remuneration practices under CPS 510 to align with risk management objectives?,CPS 510 54 The Remuneration Policys performance-based components of remuneration must be designed to encourage behaviour that supports: (a) the institutions long-term financial soundness; and (b) the risk management framework of the institution. (c) the risk management framework of the RSE licensee.
33,What is risk culture assessment?,"The Risk Culture Assessment report aggregates information gained during each step. The report provides (i) maturity levels for each Risk Culture attribute, (ii) improvement opportunities identified, and (iii) mitigation actions formulated as recommendations (see Examples)."
34,What is CPS 230?,"What is CPS 230? CPS 230 requires regulated APRA-regulated entities to prepare for service disruptions by understanding the impacts of such events to customers and the wider financial system, take action to prevent these and enhance its operational resilience."
35,When should I first contact APRA,"Once you have developed an early stage business plan it can be beneficial to have a meeting with APRA. At this meeting APRA can provide high level views of any likely challenges with your proposals, allowing you to make adjustments to ensure your business develops in a way that is most likely to result in a successful application. APRA will also be able to provide advice about APRA s prudential requirements and expectations and answer any questions you have about what to expect in the licensing process.   "
36,If I am applying for an ARPA licence will I need any other tyoe of licence,"It is likely that you will need to be licenced by ASIC. You may also need to seek authorisation or to register with other regulators, such as the RBA and AUSTRAC. You should allow time for their assessment processes."
37,I want to register a company name with an APRA regulate restricted term. How do I do this?,"Once you have lodged your application with APRA you should advise APRA in writing of the specific company name that you want to register and request APRA s consent if the name includes an APRA regulated restricted term. APRA regulated restricted terms include the words √îbank , √îbanker , √îbanking , √îbuilding society , √îcredit union , √îcredit society  and √îfriendly society . If you want to register a company name that uses the restricted words in section 66 of the Banking Act 1959 (such as the words √îbank , √îbanker  and √îbanking ), please also refer to the APRA s Restricted Words under the Banking Act 1959 Guidelines: If consent is granted by APRA, it will usually be subject to conditions, such as not using the company name publicly prior to licensing. It is an offence for a person to use a restricted word or expression under section 66 in relation to a financial business, except where APRA has granted a consent or exemption, or where a statutory exception applies.

If you want to register a company name that uses the restricted term √îfriendly society  you will need to apply for consent from APRA under section 16E of the Life Insurance Act 1995.  It is an offence for a person to use the restricted expression √ífriendly society√ì in relation to a financial business, except where APRA has granted a consent or determined that section 16E does not apply to that person. "
38,Can APRA provide further guidance beyond CPS and GPG220 Risk Management as to what should be included in the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS)?,"What is a RAS?The RAS is a document that provides boundaries within which both management and staff know how it is acceptable to operate. It provides ground rules which should be very clear for management in terms of what they are, and are not, allowed to do in pursuit of the institution s business strategy and objectives. Without such boundaries and ground rules, management (and ultimately all staff) may be unaware that they are operating outside of the risk appetite set by the Board.  How should the RAS be structured? APRA does not prescribe the structure or form of your RAS and you are generally free to adopt a risk appetite that suits the particular circumstances of your business, within the requirements of the prudential standards.A RAS should be a concise document and should not include all management reporting. It is unlikely that a RAS would need to have an appendix as it would not be expected that there would be ancillary information in a RAS.  What content should be covered in the RAS? The RAS should cover both high-level qualitative statements and, where appropriate, quantitative measures, which combined clearly capture your attitude towards, and level of acceptance of, its different risks. The RAS should consider the material risks to your company as well as to your reputation with policyholders/depositors, investors and customers. The RAS should also closely align with your strategic direction.Qualitative statements should set the overall tone for your approach to risk taking and should also clearly articulate the Board s motivations for taking on or avoiding certain types of risks or exposures. In this way, qualitative statements advise stakeholders of your attitude toward risk taking by placing high-level boundaries around the types of activities you are prepared to undertake.Qualitative statements are likely where a hard boundary for operations is being set rather than a metric with variables or a scale.How do we demonstrate that the RAS has/will be applied? Your business strategy and policies should operate in line with your RAS. Once the Board has approved your RAS, you should be able to evidence decisions being made in line with it.Additionally, as the RAS needs to be used by a number of stakeholders consistently across all of your business operations it must be easy to communicate and written in plain English. A RAS which is not easily understood will be difficult to embed throughout your organisation, as staff will not know how they are expected to behave and what they are permitted to do in order to operate within the risk appetite. * Information contained in this section is a summary of all information available from APRA including Information Papers, letters to industry and speeches. The questions and answers are designed to clarify CPS 220 Risk Management but do not form part of the law or create enforceable requirements. If there is a conflict between the guidance contained in this FAQ and CPS 220 Risk Management, then the requirements of CPS 220 Risk Management prevail."
39,What is required in the external auditor's verification of minimum captial?,"APRA requires the applicant to provide written verification from its appointed external auditor that it meets the minimum regulatory capital level required prior to licensing. This must include meeting the applicable minimum level of capital and capital ratios. The written verification should set out the steps taken by the external auditor in making the verification, including the calculation of minimum capital requirements where applicable. For life insurers, the verification should address the solvency of each statutory fund, as well as the minimum capital requirements and capital ratios for each of its statutory funds and the life company as a whole. RSE applicants are required to attach an audited copy of the applicant s statement of financial position for the last two years to their applications, but do not need a separate verification of solvency.
"
40,What documents do I need for a Non-Operating Holding Company?,The level of detail and need for difference from the underlying ADI or insurer will depend on whether there are other entities under the NOHC and the type of operations in those entities. It is possible that one set of policies can cover both the NOHC and ADI or insurer with differences for the NOHC and ADI or insurer detailed in the document.  You should discuss the requirements that will suit your circumstances with APRA.
41,Our business won't have a trading desk - do we need any policies covering market risks?,"Yes, you will need at least a policy detailing how you will address managing Interest Rate Risk in the Banking Book (IRRBB). The market risk policy/ies should also specifically state that the ADI will not undertake any proprietary trading business if this is the case. 

"
42,"As a restricted ADI/ADI applicant, when do I need to provide information about compliance with the Bank Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR)?","The BEAR regime applies to Restricted ADI/ADIs and imposes notification obligations to APRA on compliance with the BEAR regime. Templates for these notification obligations, including accountability statements and accountability maps, are available on the APRA website and will need to be completed as a pre-licence requirement. The time frame for reporting changes of 14 calendar days applies to RADIs as well as ADIs."
43,How should securitisation  warehouse funding risks be addressed?,"Start-up ADIs are often reliant on securitisation warehouse facilities to quickly build lending volumes. For start-up ADIs reliant on securitisation warehouse facilities (e.g. greater than 20 per cent of funding in any projected year), APRA expects the warehouse facility to be automatically placed into amortisation if the warehouse facility is not renewed.  Where this occurs, this will be considered long-term wholesale funding and will not add to the minimum MLH requirement. This approach reduces the risk that the reliance on warehouse facilities would result in a situation where the new ADI either has to transfer the mortgages to the warehouse provider, who may replace the new ADI as servicer or sell the mortgages to another party, or take the assets back on balance sheet at the end of the contractual term if the facility is not renewed. These scenarios would likely threaten the viability of the start-up ADI, as it is unlikely to have sufficient funding to repay the facility, and loss of mortgages will eliminate servicing income and retained equity in the warehoused mortgages.  
"
44,Is there a minimum expectation in regard to operating captial at the point of licensing?,"Yes, in addition to the expectation that Restricted ADIs must hold capital of at least $3 million plus a resolution reserve (typically $1 million), APRA expects a Restricted ADI to have sufficient operating capital to enable the entity to cover expenses and planned lending for typically the first three months after licensing. This may vary where appropriate, for example where an applicant has a profitable existing business. This operating capital would reduce the pressure on Restricted ADIs to raise money immediately after licensing and help ensure that the Restricted ADI has the resources it needs to operationalise during the restricted period. "
45,Are Restricted ADIs required to conduct some elements of banking business during the restricted phase?,"Yes, Restricted ADIs are expected to carry out some elements of banking business (i.e. at least one deposit or lending product) during the restricted phase. The Information Paper states on page 22 that APRA expects Restricted ADIs to be conducting limited business during the restricted phase. APRA strongly re-inforces this expectation. This will result in significant benefits to both the applicant and APRA, as set out below: -ensures the Restricted ADI is building both staff and operational capabilities during the restricted phase; -provides the Restricted ADI with an opportunity to test its business proposition with customers; -demonstrates to investors and potential investors that the applicant can launch a product and attract customers, which should assist the applicant in raising capital; and -allows APRA to assess the ability of the Restricted ADI to launch and manage products, providing a more informed assessment of risk management capabilities."
46,Does my entity need to comply with all of the Prudential Standards?,"Yes, your entity will need to comply with all of the applicable Prudential Standards. You should complete self-assessments against the requirements of the Prudential Standards. A self-assessment consists of a paragraph by paragraph review of the requirements of the prudential standard and cross references the relevant clause in your policies or otherwise contains an explanation as to why a requirement is not applicable. The purpose of the self-assessment is to enable management and the Board to gain comfort that the entity will meet the requirements or alternatively highlight areas of non-compliance that may lead to further discussions with APRA. APRA may ask to see your self-assessments. In the event that your entity is unable to meet a prudential requirement, there may be exceptional circumstances where APRA will consider a request to adjust or exclude a requirement, for example where the proposed business model is substantially different to existing models and it is not possible under this business model to comply with the requirement. You should be aware that a request to adjust or exclude a requirement of the Prudential Standard will likely add further time to the licence application due to the need to consider the proposal, including the impact on desired prudential outcomes and the precedent it would set. A request for an adjustment or exclusion of a requirement may not be approved. You should factor in time for the review of any request and have a contingency plan if the request is not granted."
47,What is APRA's role in reviewing policies/documents?,"APRA reviews documents to assess adherence to and understanding of prudential standards, as well as to obtain a view in regard to the competency of your staff. APRA does not approve the individual policies, as ensuring the policies are suitable for your entity is the responsibility of the Board and management. APRA will seek to ensure that the policies meet the necessary prudential requirements and that APRA has confidence that they can be implemented effectively ahead of granting a licence."
48,What does APRA do?,"The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is the prudential regulator of the financial services industry. It oversees banks, mutuals, general insurance and reinsurance companies, life insurance, private health insurers, friendly societies, and most members of the superannuation industry.

Its primary functions include Regulation and Supervision, Financial Stability, Consumer Protection, Prudential Standards, and Crisis Management."
49,How does APRA regulate bank lending safety?,"APRA also undertakes regular reviews and assessments of regulated entities. If APRA identifies any risks during the supervision process, it will intervene early to find a solution before an entity's ability to meet its financial obligations to its customers is threatened."
50,how does APRA regulate Consumer Protection?,"APRA's remit involves regulating financial entities in accordance with the prudential laws of the Commonwealth, setting prudential standards for those entities, monitoring compliance with those laws and standards through day-to-day supervision, and intervening early to resolve issues."

68,What is APRAís role in regulating insurance companies in Australia?,"APRA is responsible for the prudential regulation of, and developing prudential policy for, authorised deposit-taking institutions; general insurance, life insurance and friendly societies, private health insurance and reinsurance companies; and most of the superannuation industry."
69,What Is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)?,The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) refers to the proportion of highly liquid assets that financial institutions must hold to ensure that they can meet their short-term obligations and ride out any disruptions in the market. It is mandated by international banking agreements known as the Basel Accords.
70,Is APRA responsible for consumer complaints in the financial sector?,I don't have the information to answer this.

"
72,What happens if an institution fails to meet APRAís capital requirements?,"Any breach of the required minimum ratios is a very significant prudential concern and would signal deficiencies in financial management or underlying financial soundness. As a result, APRA takes swift action on any potential breaches of minimum capital requirements."

76,What are APRAís stress testing requirements for banks?,"The starting point in developing a stress test is to design the scenarios. This is the foundation of the exercise, and it is important that scenarios are calibrated effectively and are well targeted. For industry stress tests, APRA collaborates with both the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) on the design of scenarios and the economic parameters that define them. In 2017, APRA also engaged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in the design of the operational risk scenario.

Scenarios should be aligned to the purpose of the exercise. At a high level, these are guided within APRA by several objectives ñ namely to:

assess system-wide and entity-specific resilience to severe but plausible scenarios;
improve stress testing capabilities across the industry; and
support the identification and assessment of core and emerging risks.
In line with these objectives, APRA developed two scenarios for the 2017 industry stress test. The first was a macroeconomic scenario with a China-led recession in Australia and New Zealand. This was considered the most severe but plausible adverse economic scenario for the banking system at the time.[1] In this scenario, there was assumed to be a fall in Australian GDP of 4 per cent, while house prices declined 35 per cent nationally over three years. The chart below provides an indication of the severity of the scenario: it shows that the assumed peak unemployment rate in the scenario was similar to the 1990s recession in Australia, the United Statesí experience in the global financial crisis (GFC), as well as recent overseas regulatory stress tests."
