1,"What is the main purpose of the Basel III regulatory framework, as implemented in Australia?","The Basel III capital reforms are international banking supervisors  response to deficiencies in the regulatory capital framework identified during the global financial crisis. These reforms were endorsed prior to release by the G20, of which Australia is a member. APRA, as a member of the Basel Committee, played an active role in formulating the Basel III measures. ","The main purpose of the Basel III regulatory framework, as implemented in Australia, is to **promote a more resilient banking system** by strengthening capital requirements, improving risk management, and enhancing liquidity standards."
2,Can you explain the difference between an Australian Deposit-Taking Institution (DTI) and a Non-Deposit Taking Institution (NDTI)?,"An Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs) is an Australian government term for financial institutions in Australia which are supervised by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and authorised to accept deposits from the public.Whereas a non-deposit taking institution is a financial institution that does not have a full banking license or is not supervised by a national regulatory authority. These type of lenders are generally privately funded and do not have the normal features of a deposit taking institution (i.e. you cannot use an offset account as they have no facility to hold your funds). Generally it is the non-deposit taking institutions which will offer a non-conforming loan product. A non-conforming loan is a loan that fails to meet bank criteria for funding. This may include situations where the borrower has just started up a business and has a short trading history, has a poor credit history, or an ATO tax debt to be paid off.","The provided context does not contain information on the difference between an Australian Deposit-Taking Institution (DTI) and a Non-Deposit Taking Institution (NDTI). 

I don't have information about the difference between an Australian Deposit-Taking Institution (DTI) and a Non-Deposit Taking Institution (NDTI)."
3,How do Australian banks report their exposure to credit risk using the Internal Ratings-Based Approach (IRB)?,"IRB banks must compare regulatory expected losses (which are derived from their estimates of PD, LGD and EAD) against provisions held for credit losses and deduct any shortfall in provisions from the capital base. This leads to an increase in the capital requirement.","Australian banks report their exposure to credit risk using the Internal Ratings-Based Approach (IRB) by following the requirements outlined in the **Prudential Standard (APS) Capital Adequacy - Internal Ratings-Based Approach to Credit Risk**. 

Here's a breakdown of how IRB works in Australia:

* **Approval Process:** A bank must receive approval from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) to use the IRB approach. This involves demonstrating the bank's ability to accurately measure and manage credit risk using its internal models.
* **Risk Weighting:** The IRB approach uses internal risk ratings to assign risk weights to exposures.  This allows banks to tailor their capital requirements based on their specific risk assessments. The **APS Capital Adequacy - Internal Ratings-Based Approach to Credit Risk** outlines the specific criteria and procedures for assigning risk weights.
* **Capital Calculation:**  Once risk weights are assigned, banks must calculate their regulatory capital requirements using a specific formula prescribed in the prudential standard. This formula takes into account the risk weight, exposure amount, and other factors like the bank's overall credit risk profile. 
* **Reporting Requirements:**  The bank must report its IRB-related information to APRA. This reporting is done through specific forms and includes details on the bank's internal ratings system, risk weightings, capital calculations, and any changes to its IRB model.

**Key Points:**

* The IRB approach provides flexibility for banks to manage capital based on their specific risk assessments. 
* However, it requires a sophisticated risk management framework and internal models that are subject to rigorous APRA oversight. 
* The specific details of the IRB approach, including risk weighting procedures and capital calculation formulas, are found in the **APS Capital Adequacy - Internal Ratings-Based Approach to Credit Risk**."
4,What is the definition of a Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) under Australian prudential regulations?,"The too-big-to-fail problem refers to the fact that certain financial institutions, because of their size and/or interconnectedness, could pose a material risk to financial stability and the real economy if they were to fail. Such institutions are referred to as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs).",I don't have information about the definition of a Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) under Australian prudential regulations.
5,How do Australian banks calculate their Basel III capital requirements for Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital?,"The capital adequacy ratio is calculated by adding tier 1 capital to tier 2 capital and dividing by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the core capital of a bank, which includes equity capital and disclosed reserves. This type of capital absorbs losses without requiring the bank to cease its operations; tier 2 capital is used to absorb losses in the event of a liquidation.
Under Basel III, a banks tier 1 and tier 2 minimum capital adequacy ratio (including the capital conservation buffer) must be at least 10.5% of its risk-weighted assets (RWA). That combines the total capital requirement of 8% with the 2.5% capital conservation buffer. The capital conservation buffer recommendation is designed to build up banks capital, which they could use in periods of stress.",I don't have information about the specific calculations used by Australian banks for Basel III capital requirements for Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.
6,Can you explain the concept of Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under Australian prudential regulations?,The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) refers to the proportion of highly liquid assets that financial institutions must hold to ensure that they can meet their short-term obligations and ride out any disruptions in the market. It is mandated by international banking agreements known as the Basel Accords.,"The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is a key prudential requirement under Australian banking regulations, outlined in the **Prudential Standard APS Liquidity**. It ensures that **Authorised Deposit-Taking Institutions (ADIs)** maintain adequate levels of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to meet their short-term liquidity needs in a severe liquidity stress scenario. 

**Here's a breakdown of the LCR concept:**

* **Objective:** The LCR aims to ensure an ADI has sufficient unencumbered HQLA, readily convertible to cash, to cover their net cash outflows over a 30-calendar-day period during a severe liquidity stress scenario. This helps prevent a bank from failing due to a sudden lack of cash. 
* **Components:**  The LCR is calculated as a ratio of two components:
    * **Numerator:** The value of the ADI's stock of HQLA (high-quality liquid assets) under stressed conditions. 
    * **Denominator:** The total net cash outflow calculated according to the scenario parameters set out in the Prudential Standard. 
* **Minimum Requirement:** The LCR must be at least 100%, meaning an ADI needs to have enough HQLA to cover 100% of its expected cash outflows during the 30-day stress period.
* **Buffer:** The LCR requirement includes a buffer, which is a ""cushion"" of HQLA held above the minimum requirement. This buffer allows ADIs to absorb unexpected liquidity strains or to use for other strategic purposes.
* **Stress Testing:** ADIs must conduct regular stress tests to identify potential liquidity strains and ensure their current exposure remains within their liquidity risk tolerance. Stress test scenarios include short-term and protracted events, institution-specific and market-wide scenarios, and combinations of these. The stress test outcomes must be used to adjust the ADI's liquidity management strategy, policies, and contingency plans.
* **Eligible HQLA:** The LCR defines two categories of eligible HQLA:
    * **HQLA-A:** High-quality liquid assets that can be readily converted into cash, including cash, central bank reserves, and certain highly rated government bonds.
    * **HQLA-B:** High-quality liquid assets that may require a longer time horizon to convert to cash, such as certain corporate bonds or highly liquid equity securities.
* **Haircuts:** The LCR applies haircuts (reductions) to the value of HQLA-B to reflect the additional risk associated with their potential for less immediate liquidity. 
* **Reporting:** ADIs must report their LCR to APRA on a quarterly basis using the Reporting Form ARF-B: Liquidity Coverage Ratio. The form collects information necessary to calculate the LCR, including details on the ADI's HQLA stock, cash inflows and outflows, and stress test scenarios. 
* **Foreign ADIs:** Foreign ADIs subject to the LCR requirement must also assess their local operational capacity (LOC) – their ability to liquidate assets and make/receive payments in Australia without relying on staff outside the country. They must provide APRA with the results of this assessment upon request.

**In Summary:**

The LCR is a crucial element of Australian prudential regulations, designed to enhance the financial stability of the banking system. It requires ADIs to hold sufficient liquid assets to withstand short-term liquidity shocks, contributing to the overall resilience of the banking sector."
7,What are the key elements of a risk management framework under Australian banking regulations?,"An overarching risk management policy
An overview of the entity s approach to managing risk
Effective risk management frameworks generally describe the risk management processes to be used in the entity. This may include a common process for the assessment and management of individual risks including:
risk identification - how and when risks are identified,
risk assessment - how risks are assessed (likelihood, consequence, vulnerability, speed of onset etc), and
risk treatment - the entity s approach for treating risks (mitigate, share, transfer, accept etc).
Key risk management responsibilities
In line with element four of the Commonwealth Risk Management Policy, an entity s risk management framework should also clearly define the risk management responsibilities of officials, including the following:
Accountable Authority
Chief Risk Officer (if applicable)
Senior Executives
Audit Committee
Risk Committee (if applicable)
The risk management function
Risk owners
Control owners
Treatment owners
All staff
How the entity will report risks to both internal and external stakeholders
The attributes of the risk management culture that the entity seeks to develop
How the risk management framework and entity risk profile will be periodically reviewed and improved
The approach for measuring risk management performance
How the entity contributes to managing any shared or cross jurisdictional risks
An overview of the entity s approach to embedding risk management into its existing business processes","The key elements of a risk management framework under Australian banking regulations, as outlined by APRA, include:

* **Risk Appetite Statement:** This document defines the level of risk the institution is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives, considering the interests of depositors and policyholders. It should convey the institution's risk tolerance, expressed as risk limits, and should be approved by the board. 
* **Risk Management Strategy (RMS):** This document describes the strategies for managing material risks identified by the institution. It outlines policies and procedures, responsibilities of the risk management function, and the relationship between the board, board committee, and senior management in risk governance. The RMS must be approved by the board.
* **Business Plan:** This is a rolling plan, at least three years in duration, that outlines the institution's approach to implementing its strategic objectives. It must be reviewed at least annually, and the results reported to the board. The business plan should explicitly manage risks and how changing plans might affect the institution's risk profile.
* **Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP):**  This process assesses the institution's capital adequacy against its risk profile and includes stress testing and scenario analysis. The ICAAP report, including key assumptions, methodologies, and stress testing results, must be provided to APRA at least every three months. 
* **Management Information System (MIS):**  The MIS provides regular, accurate, and timely information on the institution's risk profile to the board, board committee, and senior management. It should enable the aggregation of exposures and risk measures across business lines and facilitate prompt reporting of breaches of limits.
* **Operational Independence:** The risk management function should be operationally independent, with appropriate authority and reporting lines to the board and senior management. This ensures its ability to conduct risk management activities objectively. 
* **Review Process:** The risk management framework must be subject to an ongoing, effective review process to ensure its appropriateness and effectiveness in identifying, measuring, evaluating, monitoring, reporting, controlling, and mitigating material risks. This includes at least annual comprehensive reviews, with the results reported to the board and relevant committees.

These elements form the foundation of a robust risk management framework for APRA-regulated institutions in Australia. They are designed to promote sound and prudent management practices, ensuring the safety and soundness of the financial system."
8,How do Australian banks report their capital adequacy requirements to APRA?,"
Australian banks report their capital adequacy requirements to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) primarily through the quarterly and annual reporting of capital adequacy and risk-weighted assets (RWA) data. The APRA monitors this data as part of its prudential supervision to ensure banks maintain sufficient capital to absorb losses while protecting depositors and maintaining financial stability. Here s a breakdown of the reporting process:

Prudential Standard APS 110: APRA requires banks to meet capital adequacy standards set by the Prudential Standard APS 110 (Capital Adequacy), which aligns with the Basel III framework. This standard outlines minimum capital ratios banks must maintain, including the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios.

Regular Reporting Requirements:

Quarterly and Annual Reports: Banks submit detailed reports on their capital positions and risk exposures, which include the composition of capital, RWA, and calculations of their capital ratios.
Reporting Forms: These submissions are standardized through APRA s reporting forms (such as ARF 110.0 for capital adequacy and ARF 112.0 for RWA). Banks complete these forms using APRA s Data Collection Solution (D2A), and APRA recently transitioned to the APRA Connect system for enhanced data collection.
Disclosures and Stress Testing: APRA also requires larger banks to disclose their capital adequacy publicly, which increases transparency. They may also conduct periodic stress tests, where banks report on their capital adequacy under hypothetical stress scenarios to assess resilience.

Supervisory Review: APRA conducts supervisory reviews of these submissions to ensure compliance and may engage in direct discussions with banks to assess their capital positions and risk management practices.

This process allows APRA to monitor and enforce capital requirements while enabling it to act swiftly in response to financial risks affecting the banking system.","Australian banks report their capital adequacy requirements to APRA through the **Prudential Standard APS 210 Capital Adequacy** and its supporting documentation. 

Here's a breakdown of the reporting process:

* **Reporting Forms:**  Banks are required to submit information to APRA using the **Reporting Form ARF** (Authorised Reporting Form). The specific ARF form used will depend on the type of institution (e.g., bank, building society, credit union) and the reporting period. 
* **Reporting Frequency:** Most reporting periods are based on a **quarter ending September, December, March, and June**. The specific reporting period may vary depending on the information being reported. 
* **Submission Method:** Banks are required to submit the information electronically using the **Direct APRA Application (DA)** method. This is a web-based solution provided by APRA.
* **Data Requirements:** The ARF forms collect data on various aspects of capital adequacy, including:
    * **Common Equity Tier 1 Capital:** This is the highest quality capital and includes retained earnings, common stock, and some non-controlling interests.
    * **Additional Tier 1 Capital:**  This includes instruments that are not as high quality as Tier 1 capital but still contribute to the bank's resilience.
    * **Tier 2 Capital:** This includes instruments that are subordinate to Tier 1 capital and may be subject to loss absorption requirements.
    * **Risk-Weighted Assets (RWAs):** These are the assets that are weighted according to their credit risk.
    * **Capital Ratios:**  These are calculated by dividing the bank's capital by its RWAs.  APRA sets minimum capital ratios that banks must maintain.

* **Reporting Due Dates:** The information is typically due within **five business days** after the end of the reporting period. 

APRA may grant extensions for due dates in certain circumstances.  

* **Quality Control:** Banks must have rigorous internal controls in place to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information they submit to APRA. This includes internal review, authorization, and testing by external auditors.

**Key Considerations:**

* **Prudential Standard APS 210 Capital Adequacy:** This document outlines the specific requirements for calculating capital adequacy and reporting to APRA.
* **Auditing Assurance Standard Board:** The AASB issues guidance statements that provide direction for external auditors to assess the accuracy of information reported by banks. 

**Additional Notes:**

* **Non-Significant Financial Institutions:**  These institutions may be subject to different reporting requirements.
* **International Banking Statistics:**  Banks are also required to report international banking statistics to APRA, which are then used to meet Australia's obligations to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). 

APRA's capital adequacy regulations aim to ensure that banks have sufficient capital to absorb potential losses and maintain financial stability."
9,Can you explain the concept of Operational Risk under Australian prudential regulations?,"Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss (including to policy owners) resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.","According to the provided context, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) defines operational risk as the **risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events**. It encompasses a wide range of risks, including:

* **Inadequate or failed internal processes:** These can include errors in processing transactions, poor risk management practices, and ineffective controls.
* **People:** This includes errors made by employees, fraud, and misconduct.
* **Systems:** This includes failures in IT systems, data breaches, and cyberattacks.
* **External events:** This includes natural disasters, economic downturns, and regulatory changes.

APRA-regulated entities in Australia are required to **effectively manage operational risk**, which includes:

* **Setting and maintaining appropriate standards of conduct and compliance.**
* **Maintaining critical operations within tolerance levels of disruption.**
* **Managing risks associated with the use of service providers.**
* **Identifying, assessing, and managing operational risks.**

The **key principles** for managing operational risk are:

* **Prevent disruption to critical operations.**
* **Adapt processes and systems to continue operating within tolerance levels of disruption.**
* **Return to normal operations promptly after disruption.**
* **Reliance on service providers only if it ensures continued compliance with prudential obligations.**

APRA-regulated entities are required to **develop and maintain a risk management framework** to manage operational risk. This framework must include:

* **Governance arrangements** to oversee operational risk assessment and profile, risk appetite, and tolerance levels.
* **Internal controls** designed to operate effectively in managing operational risk.
* **Monitoring, analysis, and reporting** of operational risk, including escalation processes.
* **Operational incident and event management** and business continuity plans (BCPs).
* **Regular review** of operational risk management.

The **board of directors** of an APRA-regulated entity is **ultimately responsible** for overseeing the entity's operational risk management, including business continuity management and service provider arrangements. 

APRA may **require an independent review** of an entity's operational risk management if it identifies a material weakness. It may also require the entity to develop a remediation program, hold additional capital, impose conditions on its license, or take other actions required for prudential supervision."
10,What is the definition of an Integrated Disclosure Framework (IDF) under Australian banking regulations?,"The integrated report is a concise communication about how an organisation s strategy, governance, performance and prospects, in the context of its external environment, lead to value creation over time. It drives high-quality corporate reporting and connectivity between financial statements and sustainability-related financial disclosures, and brings together information investors need to assess a company s ability to create value over time. An integrated report should be prepared in accordance with the Integrated Reporting Framework (IR Framework), which is an IFRS Foundation resource.
",I don't have information about an Integrated Disclosure Framework (IDF) under Australian banking regulations.
11,How do Australian banks report their exposure to liquidity risk using the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)?,"Australian banks report their exposure to liquidity risk through the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under APRA s Prudential Standard APS 210 (Liquidity). The LCR is designed to ensure banks maintain adequate levels of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to withstand a 30-day liquidity stress scenario. Here s an overview of how the reporting works:

1. **Prudential Standard APS 210**: The LCR requirement is part of APRA s APS 210, which outlines standards for liquidity risk management. This standard requires banks to maintain an LCR of at least 100%, meaning they should hold enough HQLA to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period.

2. **Monthly Reporting**:
   - **APRA s Reporting Forms**: Banks report their LCR metrics monthly to APRA using specific forms like ARF 210.1A, which captures details on HQLA holdings, cash outflows, and inflows.
   - **Calculation of the LCR**: Banks calculate their LCR by dividing the total value of HQLA by net cash outflows expected over a 30-day stress period. These net outflows include expected outflows minus expected inflows, as per APRA s defined parameters.

3. **Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures**:
   - **Quarterly Public Disclosures**: Large banks are required to publicly disclose their LCR on a quarterly basis, including a breakdown of HQLA and significant inflow/outflow categories. This transparency aims to boost market confidence in banks  liquidity positions.
   - **Additional Qualitative Information**: Banks often provide contextual information on liquidity risk management practices, including descriptions of the key drivers of their LCR ratios and any significant changes in the quarter.

4. **Daily Monitoring for Large Banks**: APRA requires large institutions to monitor their LCR on a daily basis. Although monthly reporting is standard, APRA may request daily data in times of financial stress for enhanced supervision.

5. **Stress Testing**: APRA conducts regular stress tests where banks are required to simulate liquidity stress scenarios and report how these would impact their LCR. These exercises help APRA assess the robustness of banks  liquidity management strategies.

This framework ensures Australian banks manage and report liquidity risk consistently, enabling APRA to monitor system-wide liquidity resilience and intervene if necessary.","The LCR is a key prudential standard in Australia, requiring ADIs to maintain a sufficient level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to meet their liquidity needs over a 30-day time period under a severe stress scenario.

Here's how ADIs report their LCR exposure:

**1. Stock of HQLA:**
   * ADIs must report the total value of their HQLA stock, which includes two categories:
      * **HQLAa:** Assets that are highly liquid and readily convertible to cash with minimal haircut.
      * **HQLAb:** Assets that are less liquid than HQLAa but still qualify as HQLA, subject to a higher haircut.

**2. Total Net Cash Outflow:**
   * ADIs calculate their total expected net cash outflow over the 30-day stress period. This is calculated by multiplying the outstanding balance of various liabilities and off-balance sheet commitments by the expected run-off rate, as specified in APRA's guidelines.

**3. LCR Calculation:**
   * The LCR is calculated by dividing the value of the stock of HQLA by the total net cash outflow. The minimum LCR requirement is 100%, meaning that ADIs must have enough HQLA to cover 100% of their expected net cash outflow over the 30-day stress period.

**4. Reporting Requirements:**
   * ADIs must report their LCR to APRA on a quarterly basis through the Reporting Standard AR Liquidity. This reporting standard requires ADIs to provide detailed information on their HQLA stock, total net cash outflow, and LCR calculation.

**5. Considerations for Foreign ADIs:**
   * Foreign ADIs operating in Australia must also comply with the LCR requirements and report their LCR to APRA. They must ensure that their local operational capacity is adequate to liquidate assets and make/receive payments without assistance from staff located outside Australia.

**Additional Information:**

* The LCR is a key tool for APRA to assess the liquidity risk profile of ADIs and ensure their resilience in times of stress.
* APRA may require ADIs to maintain a higher minimum LCR if they are concerned about their liquidity risk profile, the quality of their liquidity risk management, or if they have a higher liquidity risk tolerance.
* ADIs are required to conduct stress tests on a regular basis to assess the impact of various stress scenarios on their liquidity position.
* The LCR is just one of several prudential standards that APRA uses to regulate the Australian banking sector.

The LCR is a crucial component of APRA's regulatory framework, designed to ensure that the Australian banking system remains stable and resilient in the face of liquidity stress."
12,Can you explain the concept of Credit Risk Management under Australian prudential regulations?,"Credit management is the process of deciding which customers to extend credit to and evaluating those customers creditworthiness over time. It involves setting credit limits for customers, monitoring customer payments and collections, and assessing the risks associated with extending credit to customers.","The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) sets out comprehensive guidelines for Credit Risk Management (CRM) for Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs) in Prudential Standard APS 220 Credit Risk Management. This standard ensures ADIs have robust frameworks to identify, measure, monitor, control, and mitigate credit risk.

Here's a breakdown of key aspects:

**1. Credit Risk Appetite and Strategy:**

* **Risk Appetite:** ADIs must establish a clearly articulated credit risk appetite statement, defining the maximum level of credit risk they are willing to accept.
* **Risk Management Strategy:** A comprehensive credit risk management strategy must be developed, outlining objectives for credit origination, assessment, and approval activities. This strategy should align with the ADI's risk appetite, credit risk profile, and market conditions.

**2. Policy and Processes:**

* **Credit Risk Policy:** A prudent and documented credit risk policy should cover all stages of the credit lifecycle, including origination, assessment, approval, monitoring, and management.
* **Diversification:** The policy should ensure the credit portfolio is adequately diversified across target markets, credit products, industries, geographical locations, and borrowers, minimizing concentration risk.

**3. Credit Origination and Assessment:**

* **Diligence:**  Higher levels of diligence are required for credit assessments and approval decisions made for borrowers located in distant geographical locations or with material changes in origination channels.
* **Third-Party Involvement:**  For third-party brokers or introducers involved in credit origination, ADIs must establish sound oversight processes and ensure reasonable inquiries are made to verify borrower information.
* **Creditworthiness:** The credit assessment process must comprehensively assess the borrower's credit risk, primarily focusing on their repayment capacity. Undue reliance on collateral or external credit ratings is discouraged.

**4. Credit Administration, Measurement, and Monitoring:**

* **Classification and Provisioning:**  ADIs must classify credit risk exposures as performing or nonperforming, with adequate documentation to support classification. Provisioning levels must reflect realistic repayment recovery expectations.
* **Nonperforming Exposure:**  Nonperforming exposures must be measured as the whole amount, including unpaid interest and off-balance sheet exposures.
* **Concentration Risk:**  ADIs need to regularly assess the trend of concentration risk related to credit exposures and potential mitigation strategies.

**5. Prudential Requirements:**

* **Supervisory Limits:** APRA may set limits on specific exposure categories or types of lending activities to ensure ADIs are not taking on excessive risk.
* **Adequacy of Provision:** APRA may require ADIs to amend their credit risk management policies, processes, or practices if their approach is deemed inadequate. This may involve increasing provisioning levels or write-offs, or enhancing capital adequacy.
* **Special Purpose Engagement:**  APRA may require ADIs to appoint independent parties to review specific aspects of their CRM, including provisioning practices.

**Overall, APRA's Credit Risk Management guidelines aim to ensure ADIs have robust frameworks to protect themselves and depositors from potential credit losses. By adhering to these guidelines, ADIs contribute to the stability of the financial system.**"
13,What are the key elements of a Capital Adequacy Framework under Australian banking regulations?,"Under Australian banking regulations, the Capital Adequacy Framework, governed by APRA, is designed to ensure banks maintain sufficient capital to absorb losses, support depositor protection, and promote financial stability. The key elements of this framework include:

1. **Minimum Capital Requirements**:
   - **Tiered Capital Ratios**: APRA requires banks to meet minimum capital ratios as outlined in Prudential Standard APS 110 (Capital Adequacy), consistent with the Basel III framework. These include:
     - **Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)**: The highest-quality capital, consisting mainly of common shares and retained earnings.
     - **Tier 1 Capital**: CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital instruments.
     - **Total Capital Ratio**: Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital, which includes subordinated debt and other forms of capital that can absorb losses.
   - **Capital Buffers**: Banks must maintain additional buffers above minimum ratios, including a **Capital Conservation Buffer** and, for larger banks, a **Countercyclical Capital Buffer** to protect against cyclical downturns.

2. **Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA)**:
   - Banks calculate their RWA based on the risk profile of their assets, where riskier assets receive higher weights. APRA requires banks to categorize their assets according to the level of credit, market, and operational risks they pose, which helps determine the capital needed to support these assets.

3. **Pillar 2 Ã Supervisory Review**:
   - APRA performs a **Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP)** under Pillar 2 to assess banks  internal capital adequacy and risk management processes. Based on its evaluation, APRA may impose additional capital requirements to cover risks specific to each institution beyond the Pillar 1 minimums.

4. **Pillar 3 Ã Market Discipline and Disclosure**:
   - Banks are required to disclose certain information regarding their capital adequacy and risk exposures on a regular basis under Pillar 3. These disclosures, which include capital ratios, RWA breakdowns, and descriptions of risk management practices, aim to increase transparency and market discipline by enabling stakeholders to assess a bank s risk and capital position.

5. **Stress Testing**:
   - APRA mandates regular stress testing as part of banks  internal capital adequacy assessments and also conducts industry-wide stress tests. These tests simulate adverse scenarios to evaluate the resilience of banks  capital positions and assess whether they hold sufficient capital to withstand economic shocks.

6. **Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)**:
   - Each bank must have an ICAAP, which is a structured framework for assessing capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile and operational strategy. The ICAAP, submitted annually to APRA, includes capital planning, risk measurement, and scenario analysis to ensure sufficient capital levels are maintained under varying economic conditions.

The Capital Adequacy Framework, with its requirements for minimum capital ratios, RWA calculations, supervisory review, disclosure, stress testing, and ICAAP, provides APRA with a comprehensive approach to overseeing the capital strength and resilience of Australian banks.","The key elements of a Capital Adequacy Framework under Australian banking regulations, as outlined in the provided context, are:

**1. Minimum Risk-Based Capital Adequacy Requirements:**
- **Prudential Capital Requirements (PCRs):** These are expressed as a percentage of an ADI's Total Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA), and they set a minimum level of capital that an ADI must maintain at all times.  
- **Capital Conservation Buffer:**  This buffer adds to the PCR, providing a further layer of capital protection and ensuring that ADIs maintain a resilient capital position during periods of financial stress.
- **Countercyclical Capital Buffer:**  This buffer is applied during periods of economic expansion to help mitigate the potential for excessive credit growth and systemic risk.
- **Minimum Dollar Amount of Capital:** APRA may also set a minimum dollar amount of capital that ADIs must maintain, regardless of their risk profile.
- **Minimum Leverage Ratio Requirement:**  This requirement sets a minimum level of capital relative to an ADI's total assets, providing a simple measure of capital adequacy that is not tied to specific risk weights.

**2. Capital Distribution Constraints:**
- Restrictions are placed on capital distributions, including dividends, share buybacks, and discretionary bonus payments. These constraints aim to ensure that ADIs do not distribute capital excessively, particularly when their capital position is below the specified buffer ranges.

**3. Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP):**
- ADIs are required to have a robust and documented ICAAP that outlines their approach to capital management. 
- The ICAAP should include:
    -  Capital targets and triggers for management action to avert potential breaches of capital requirements.
    -  Stress testing and scenario analysis to assess potential risk exposures.
    -  A review process to ensure that the ICAAP remains relevant and effective.
    -  A report to APRA outlining the implementation of the ICAAP.

**4. Public Disclosure Requirements:**
- ADIs are required to publicly disclose information about their capital adequacy, including:
    -  Their regulatory capital composition.
    -  The breakdown of their risk exposure.
    -  Their leverage ratio.
    -  Their liquidity positions.
    -  Their remuneration practices.
    -  Their assessment of potential designation as a Global Systemically Important Bank (GSIB).

These elements form the core of the Capital Adequacy Framework within Australian banking regulations, ensuring that ADIs maintain sufficient capital to absorb potential losses and support their ongoing operations."
14,How do Australian banks calculate their risk-weighted assets (RWA) under Basel III?,"
Banks calculate risk-weighted assets by multiplying the exposure amount by the relevant risk weight for the type of loan or asset. A bank repeats this calculation for all of its loans and assets, and adds them together to calculate total credit risk-weighted assets.",The context does not contain the information about how Australian banks calculate their risk-weighted assets (RWA) under Basel III. I don't have information about the specific methods used by Australian banks to calculate RWA under Basel III.
15,Can you explain the concept of Systemic Risk under Australian prudential regulations?,Systemic risk is the risk of financial system disruption so widespread or severe that it causes material damage to the real economy. ,I don't have information about the concept of Systemic Risk under Australian prudential regulations in the provided context.
16,Can you explain the concept of Disclosures for the identification of potential G-SIBs under Australian prudential regulations?,"Every year, a sample of international banks must provide information to the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS) for assessment against a set of indicators that identify potential Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs).","According to the provided text, the disclosure requirement for the identification of potential Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) is found in **Attachment H** of the prudential standard. 

This attachment outlines the general requirement for Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs) to disclose information about potential G-SIBs. 

The text also mentions that ADIs must disclose this information in their **annual financial report**, which is required under the **Corporations Act**.

However, the provided context does not specify the exact nature of the information that must be disclosed.  You would need to refer to the relevant prudential standard or the **Attachment H** directly to find detailed instructions on the type of data that ADIs are obligated to disclose."
17,Can you explain the concept of Liquidity Risk under Australian prudential regulations?,"Liquidity risk is the possibility an institution will be unable to obtain funds, such as customer deposits or borrowed funds, at a reasonable price or within a necessary period to meet its financial obligations.","## Liquidity Risk under Australian Prudential Regulations:

Australian prudential regulations, specifically APRA guidelines, define **liquidity risk** as the risk that an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) may be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. This risk arises from the possibility of a mismatch between the ADI's assets and liabilities in terms of their maturity and liquidity.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the concept:

**Key principles:**

* **Maintain sufficient liquidity:** ADIs must have enough liquid assets to meet their obligations, even under stressed conditions. This includes holding a minimum level of liquid assets to withstand a severe liquidity stress event.
* **Stable funding sources:** ADIs must ensure their activities are funded from stable sources on an ongoing basis. This means relying on funding sources that are not likely to dry up in times of market stress.
* **Early warning and response:** ADIs must have systems in place to identify and manage emerging liquidity risks. This includes developing contingency funding plans and notifying APRA immediately if they face severe liquidity stress.

**Specific requirements:**

APRA guidelines specify several requirements to manage liquidity risk, including:

* **Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR):** This ratio requires ADIs to maintain a minimum amount of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be converted into cash to cover net cash outflows over a 30-day stress scenario. The LCR aims to ensure ADIs have enough liquid assets to withstand short-term liquidity stress.
* **Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR):** This ratio aims to ensure ADIs have a stable funding structure by considering the maturity of their assets and liabilities over a one-year time horizon. The NSFR ensures ADIs are not reliant on short-term funding that could be withdrawn during market stress.
* **Minimum Liquidity Holding (MLH):** ADIs must hold a minimum of 9% of their liabilities in specified liquid assets, as outlined in APRA's guidelines. 
* **Stress Testing:** ADIs are required to conduct regular stress tests using various scenarios to assess their vulnerability to potential liquidity strains. The results of these tests must inform their liquidity management strategy and contingency planning.
* **Liquidity Risk Management Framework:** ADIs must have a comprehensive framework in place for managing liquidity risk. This framework must include documented policies, procedures, and controls for identifying, measuring, monitoring, and managing liquidity risk.

**Public Disclosure:**

ADIs are required to make public disclosure about their liquidity risk profile, risk management practices, and liquidity metrics such as the LCR, NSFR, and MLH. These disclosures aim to promote transparency in the financial markets and enhance market discipline.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Foreign ADIs:** Special considerations apply to foreign ADIs operating in Australia. These include requirements to assess their local operational capacity and their ability to liquidate assets and receive payments without relying on staff outside Australia.
* **Securitisation:** ADIs must consider the liquidity implications of securitisation activities and may be required to exclude certain securitised assets from their liquidity holdings.

**Overall, APRA's liquidity risk regulations aim to ensure ADIs are resilient to potential liquidity pressures and maintain financial stability in the Australian banking system.**"
18,Who are High-Risk Customers?,"High-risk customers are individuals or entities that pose a greater risk to a business or financial institution due to different factors. These factors may include a higher likelihood of involvement in illegal activities, financial instability, or a history of behavior that could lead to financial losses for the institution.

Financial institutions are required to identify high-risk customers for several reasons. One of the most important reasons is compliance with AML requirements and regulations. But what is AML compliance?",I don't have information about High-Risk Customers.  The provided context focuses on Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) guidelines for operational risk management and business continuity.
19,What is the meaning of credit risk mitigation?,"Credit risk mitigation is a process by which a company reduces its exposure to credit risks. It involves assessing creditworthiness, monitoring credit profiles, and managing risks to prevent revenue loss, ensuring a healthy balance sheet and cash flows.","Credit risk mitigation refers to strategies and techniques employed by financial institutions to reduce the potential losses associated with lending and credit exposures.  These strategies aim to minimize the risk of borrowers failing to repay their obligations. Some common methods include: 
* **Collateral:**  Securing a loan with an asset that can be liquidated if the borrower defaults.
* **Guarantees:**  A third party promising to repay the loan if the borrower defaults.
* **Credit Derivatives:**  Financial instruments designed to transfer credit risk to another party. 

Credit risk mitigation is a crucial element of sound credit risk management."
20,Do Australian banks have to report their exposure to interest rate risk?,"The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) requires banks to summarise and report on the extent of interest rate risk that they face. For the banking book, this is measured as the expected change in economic value from a 200 basis point increase in interest rates at all maturities.","Yes, Australian banks are required to report their exposure to interest rate risk. 

This is specifically addressed in the **Financial Sector Collection Data Reporting Standard Determination Reporting Standard AR Interest Rate Risk Banking Book IRRBB**. This standard outlines the overall requirement for providing information to APRA regarding interest rate risk on a bank's banking book and the regulatory capital it holds."
21,How do you calculate risk-weighted assets in RWA?,"Banks calculate risk-weighted assets by multiplying the exposure amount by the relevant risk weight for the type of loan or asset. A bank repeats this calculation for all of its loans and assets, and adds them together to calculate total credit risk-weighted assets.","RWA, or Risk-Weighted Assets, are calculated according to the following steps:

**1. Determine the Risk Weight:**

* **For credit risk:** This involves applying risk weights to different types of assets based on their creditworthiness.
* **For operational risk:** This involves assigning weights based on the institution's operational risk profile.
* **For market risk:** This involves applying weights based on the riskiness of the market exposure.

**2. Calculate the Risk-Weighted Exposure:**

* Multiply the value of each asset or exposure by its corresponding risk weight.

**3. Sum the Risk-Weighted Exposures:**

* Add up the risk-weighted exposures of all assets and exposures.

**4. Apply Additional Adjustments (if applicable):**

* Regulatory adjustments, such as capital deductions for certain assets or exposures, may need to be considered.

**5. Calculate the Total RWA:**

* The final RWA is the sum of all risk-weighted exposures and any applicable adjustments.

**Specific Calculations based on the provided context:**

* **Standardized Approach (SA):** For non-significant financial institutions, RWA is calculated as a sum of RWA calculated based on the Prudential Standards, including:
    * APS 210 Capital Adequacy: Standardized Approach for Credit Risk
    * APS 230 Securitisation
    * APS 220 Capital Adequacy: Standardized Measurement Approach for Operational Risk
    * APS 250 Capital Adequacy: Market Risk

* **Internal Ratings-Based Approach (IRB):** For significant financial institutions, RWA is calculated as the greater of:
    * The sum of RWA determined based on APS 215 Capital Adequacy: Internal Ratings-Based Approach for Credit Risk and APS 220 Capital Adequacy: Standardized Measurement Approach for Operational Risk.
    * The sum of RWA based on APS 215 Capital Adequacy: Internal Ratings-Based Approach for Credit Risk and APS 250 Capital Adequacy: Market Risk.
    * The sum of RWA determined based on APS 215 Capital Adequacy: Internal Ratings-Based Approach for Credit Risk and APS 240 Capital Adequacy: Interest Rate Risk - Banking Book.

The provided context details the calculation of RWA for specific exposures, such as securitisation exposure, counterparty credit risk, and market risk."

24,What is counterparty credit risk in derivatives?,Counterparty credit risk is the risk arising from the possibility that the counterparty may default on amounts owned on a derivative transaction.,"Counterparty credit risk in derivatives refers to the risk that a counterparty to a derivative transaction will default on their obligations, leading to a financial loss for the other party. This risk arises because derivative contracts are typically settled on a net basis, meaning that only the difference between the value of the contract at the time of settlement is exchanged. If a counterparty defaults, the other party may not receive the full amount they are owed."
25,What is concentration risk?,Concentration risk is the potential for a loss in value of an investment portfolio or a financial institution when an individual or group of exposures move together in an unfavorable direction. The implication of concentration risk is that it generates such a significant loss that recovery is unlikely.,"Concentration risk refers to the potential for significant losses due to the concentration of exposures within a particular counterparty, group of connected counterparties, industry sector, geographical location, or type of financial product."
26,What measures for the management of interest rate risk can be used by an Organisation?,"Gap analysis, duration analysis and stimulation models are interest rate risk measurement techniques. Each institution should use at least one, and preferably a combination of these techniques in managing its interest rate risk exposure.","APRA guidelines for managing interest rate risk focus on the banking book, which includes assets and liabilities that are not traded in the market. The guidelines require institutions to manage interest rate risk through a combination of measures, including:

* **Repricing assumptions:** These assumptions are used to estimate how interest rates will affect the future cash flows of banking book items. 
* **Interest rate sensitivity:** This measure quantifies how much the value of a banking book item will change for every percentage point change in interest rates.
* **Stress testing:** This involves assessing the impact of adverse interest rate scenarios on the institution's financial position.
* **Internal models:** These models can be used to calculate the capital requirement for interest rate risk.

The guidelines also require institutions to have a robust framework for managing interest rate risk, including:

* **A risk appetite statement:** This defines the level of interest rate risk the institution is willing to accept.
* **A risk management strategy:** This outlines the institution's approach to managing interest rate risk.
* **Policy and procedures:** These provide guidance on how to identify, measure, monitor, control, and mitigate interest rate risk.
* **Reporting and monitoring:** This ensures that the board and senior management are regularly informed about the institution's interest rate risk profile. 
* **Internal control:** These ensure that the institution has the necessary controls in place to manage interest rate risk.

APRA guidelines emphasize a holistic approach to managing interest rate risk, taking into account all aspects of the institution's business. This includes the institution's risk appetite, risk management strategy, and internal controls."
27,How must banks assess and manage risks associated with outsourcing arrangements according to CPS 231?,All risks arising from outsourcing material business activities must be appropriately managed to ensure that the APRA-regulated entity is able to meet both its financial and service obligations to its depositors and/or policyholders. notify APRA after entering into agreements to outsource material business activities.,"According to CPS 231, APRA-regulated institutions must identify, assess, manage, mitigate and report the risks associated with outsourcing arrangements to ensure they can meet their financial service obligations to depositors, policyholders, and other stakeholders. This includes:

* **Identifying and assessing risks**: This involves identifying the potential risks associated with outsourcing a particular activity, such as:
    * **Service provider performance**:  Ensuring the service provider has the capacity and capability to deliver the required services reliably and effectively.
    * **Operational risk**: This includes risks related to data security, information technology systems, and business continuity.
    * **Compliance risk**:  The service provider must comply with the institution's and APRA's requirements.
    * **Reputational risk**: Outsourcing could impact the institution's reputation if the service provider fails to meet its obligations.
    * **Strategic risk**: The potential for outsourcing to affect the institution's long-term strategic goals and its ability to adapt to change.
* **Managing and mitigating risks**:  APRA-regulated institutions must put in place appropriate controls to manage and mitigate these risks. This may include:
    * **Due diligence**: Thoroughly vetting potential service providers to assess their financial stability, expertise, and track record.
    * **Contractual arrangements**:  Developing comprehensive agreements with service providers that clearly define the scope of services, performance standards, termination provisions, and risk allocation.
    * **Monitoring and oversight**:  Regularly monitoring the performance of the service provider and the effectiveness of the outsourcing arrangement, including both day-to-day operational monitoring and senior management involvement.
    * **Contingency planning**: Developing contingency plans to address potential service disruptions and ensuring the institution can effectively manage the outsourced activity in-house if necessary.
* **Reporting risks**:  The institution must report the risks associated with outsourcing to the board, audit committee, and compliance function, as well as to APRA. This reporting should be done regularly and should include information about:
    * **The nature and extent of the risks**: Including the potential financial, operational, and reputational impacts.
    * **The mitigation strategies in place**: This includes the effectiveness of these strategies.
    * **Any significant problems or potential issues**:  That could materially affect the outsourcing arrangement.
    * **The institution's strategy for managing the outsourced activity**: Including any transition arrangements if the agreement is terminated.

Additionally, the institution must:

* **Ensure compliance with the institution's outsourcing policy**:  The head of the group must ensure that any material outsourcing activity is undertaken in a way that complies with the institution's policy.
* **Demonstrate to APRA**: That the institution has appropriately assessed and managed the risks associated with outsourcing.
* **Maintain a comprehensive risk management framework**:  That addresses all the risks associated with outsourcing.

Ultimately, the board of the APRA-regulated institution is responsible for overseeing all material outsourcing arrangements."
28,"What are the requirements for business continuity planning under CPS 232, and how must banks demonstrate resilience to operational disruptions?","Under CPS 232, an APRA-regulated entity must identify, assess, manage, mitigate and report on potential business continuity risks to ensure that it can meet its financial and service obligations.","CPS 232 outlines the requirements for business continuity planning (BCP) for APRA-regulated institutions. Here's a breakdown:

**Business Continuity Management Policy (BCM Policy):**

* **Board Approval:** The institution's BCM policy must be approved by the board.
* **Up-to-Date and Documented:** The policy should be kept current, well-documented, and clearly state the institution's objectives and approach to BCM.
* **Roles and Responsibilities:** The policy must clearly define the roles, responsibilities, and authorities of all parties involved in BCM. 

**Business Impact Analysis (BIA):**

* **Identifying Critical Functions:** Institutions must identify critical business functions, resources, and infrastructure, and assess their potential impact in the event of a disruption.
* **Plausible Disruption Scenarios:** APRA-regulated institutions must consider plausible disruption scenarios, varying in length and severity, and assess their potential impact on depositors, policyholders, and the institution's financial, legal, regulatory, and reputational standing.

**Recovery Objective Strategy:**

* **Defined Goals:** Institutions must define specific goals for recovering critical business operations to a specified service level within a defined time period following a disruption.
* **Implementation Strategy:**  The recovery objective strategy must be documented and implemented based on the results of the BIA and the size and complexity of the institution. 

**Business Continuity Plan (BCP):**

* **Documentation:** Institutions must maintain a documented BCP that outlines procedures and information to enable the management of initial disruption, crisis management, and the recovery of critical business operations.
* **Specific Requirements:** The BCP must reflect the specific requirements of the institution, including:
    * Identification of critical business operations.
    * Recovery levels and time targets for critical business operations.
    * Recovery strategies for critical business operations.
    * Infrastructure and resources needed to implement the BCP.
    * Roles, responsibilities, and authorities relating to the BCP.
* **Communication Plan:**  A communication plan must be developed for both internal staff and external stakeholders.
* **Outsourcing:** For material business activities outsourced, institutions must ensure the adequacy of the service provider's BCP, considering dependencies between the two.

**Review and Testing:**

* **Regular Review:** The BCP must be reviewed and tested at least annually, or more frequently if there are material changes to business operations.
* **Testing Scope:** Testing must cover all critical operations, including an annual business continuity exercise.
* **Scenario Range:** Testing must cover a range of severe, plausible scenarios, including disruption of services provided by material service providers.
* **Reporting:** Results of testing must be formally reported to the board or delegated management.
* **Updating:** The BCP must be updated to reflect any shortcomings identified during testing.

**APRA Notification:**

* **Major Disruptions:** Institutions must notify APRA as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours, after experiencing a major disruption that could materially impact their risk profile and financial soundness. 
* **Notification Content:** The notification must explain the nature of the disruption, the actions taken, the likely effects, and the timeframe for returning to normal operations.
* **Resumption of Normal Operations:** Institutions must notify APRA once normal operations resume. 

**Demonstrating Resilience:**

APRA-regulated institutions must demonstrate resilience to operational disruptions by:

* **Setting and Maintaining Appropriate Tolerance Levels:** This involves defining the maximum acceptable disruption time and data loss for critical operations.
* **Regular Testing and Reporting:** Through regular testing and reporting of BCP effectiveness, institutions demonstrate their ability to meet tolerance levels and identify areas for improvement.
* **Responding Promptly to Disruptions:** Institutions must have clear procedures in place to respond promptly and effectively to disruptions, minimizing their impact on depositors, policyholders, and the broader financial system.

The overarching principle is that institutions must have a robust and comprehensive BCP that is regularly reviewed, tested, and updated to ensure they can manage and recover from operational disruptions effectively."
29,What are the obligations for banks under CPS 234 regarding the protection of information assets and managing cyber security risks?,"Under CPS 234, APRA-regulated entities must implement information security controls to protect information assets, including those managed by related or third-parties, in a timely manner and commensurate with: Existing and emerging vulnerabilities and threats to critical and sensitive information assets.","CPS 234 sets out the requirements for APRA-regulated entities to have robust information security policies and practices. Here's a breakdown of the key obligations for banks specifically related to information asset protection and cyber security:

**Information Asset Identification and Classification:**

* **Comprehensive Identification:** Banks must identify all information assets under their management, including those managed by related parties and third parties.
* **Classification:** These information assets must be classified based on their criticality and sensitivity, reflecting the potential impact of a cyber security incident on the bank's financial and non-financial interests, depositors, policyholders, beneficiaries, and customers. 

**Implementation of Controls:**

* **Commensurate Controls:** Banks must implement information security controls to protect their information assets, taking into account the vulnerability and threat to each asset. The level of control must be commensurate with the criticality and sensitivity of the asset.
* **Timely Implementation:** These controls must be implemented in a timely manner, considering the stage of the information asset within its lifecycle and the potential consequences of a cyber security incident.

**Incident Management:**

* **Robust Mechanisms:** Banks must have a robust mechanism in place to detect and respond to cyber security incidents in a timely manner.
* **Response Plan:** A well-defined information security response plan must be maintained, covering aspects such as incident detection, post-incident review, escalation reporting, and oversight by the board, governing body, and individuals responsible for incident management.
* **Annual Review and Testing:** The response plan must be reviewed and tested annually to ensure its effectiveness and relevance.

**Control Testing:**

* **Regular and Comprehensible Testing:** Banks must systematically test the effectiveness of their information security controls with a frequency and nature commensurate with the vulnerability, threat, change, and criticality of the information assets, as well as the potential consequences of a cyber security incident. 
* **Assessment and Reporting:** The results of control testing must be assessed, any deficiencies remediated promptly, and the results reported to the board and senior management. 
* **Independent Expertise:** Testing must be conducted by appropriately skilled and functionally independent specialists.
* **Annual Review:** The sufficiency of the testing program must be reviewed at least annually, considering any material changes to the information assets or the business environment. 

**Internal Audit:**

* **Scope of Review:** Internal audits must review the design and operating effectiveness of information security controls, including those maintained by related parties and third parties. 
* **Skilled Personnel:** The provision of assurance on information security controls must be carried out by appropriately skilled personnel.
* **Third-Party Assurance:** Internal audits must assess the information security control assurance provided by related parties and third parties if the internal audit intends to rely on this assurance.

**APRA Notification:**

* **Prompt Notification:** Banks must notify APRA as soon as possible, no later than one hour, if they become aware of a cyber security incident that has materially affected or could potentially materially affect their financial or non-financial interests, depositors, policyholders, beneficiaries, or customers. 

These obligations are further elaborated upon within CPS 234, outlining specific requirements and expectations for each area."
30,What is the CPS 510 governance standard?,"This standard requires an entity to have a sound governance framework and to conduct its affairs with a high degree of integrity. Entities must meet specific requirements for board committees, appointments, renewal and performance. This is a core standard in the Governance Pillar.",I don't have information about CPS 510 governance standard.
31,What is a responsible person in APRA?,"Persons who are responsible for the management and oversight of an APRA-regulated entity need to have appropriate skills, experience and knowledge and act with honesty and integrity. These skills and qualities strengthen the protection afforded to depositors, policyholders and/or other stakeholders.","APRA defines a ""responsible person"" as an individual whose activity may materially affect, either directly or indirectly, the whole or a substantial part of the business or financial standing of an APRA-regulated institution or its group. This definition encompasses a broad range of individuals, including:

* **Directors:** Individuals who make or participate in making decisions affecting the whole or substantial part of the institution's business.
* **Senior Managers:** Individuals with senior management responsibilities, including those who enforce policies, implement strategies, and oversee development.
* **Employees:** Individuals who play a significant role in the management and control of the institution or its group.
* **Consultants and Contractors:** Individuals who may have material impact on the institution's prudential matters.

APRA may also determine that a person is a responsible person if they are satisfied that the person plays a significant role in the management and control of the institution or its group and their activity may materially impact prudential matters."
32,How must banks structure their remuneration practices under CPS 510 to align with risk management objectives?,CPS 510 54 The Remuneration Policys performance-based components of remuneration must be designed to encourage behaviour that supports: (a) the institutions long-term financial soundness; and (b) the risk management framework of the institution. (c) the risk management framework of the RSE licensee.,"APRA's Prudential Standard CPS 510, Remuneration, outlines requirements for banks to design remuneration arrangements that are aligned with their risk management objectives. This includes:

* **Aligning Remuneration with Risk:**  Variable remuneration arrangements must be structured to reflect the financial and non-financial risks that could materially impact the entity's risk profile, sustainable performance, and long-term soundness. This ensures that remuneration incentives are aligned with responsible risk-taking.
* **Payout and Vesting Schedules:**  Payout and vesting schedules for variable remuneration should be commensurate with the potential range of risk performance outcomes, sensitive to the time horizon of the risks involved, and aligned with appropriate risk-adjusted performance targets.
* **Variable Remuneration Adjustment Tools:**  Remuneration frameworks must include appropriate adjustment tools to incentivize responsible risk management. These tools should be clearly defined and include:
    * **In-period Adjustments (Malus):** Allow for downward adjustments to remuneration during the performance period if there is a material adverse risk or conduct outcome.
    * **Clawback Arrangements:**  Enable the recovery of variable remuneration paid or vested if there is significant misconduct or a material adverse outcome that occurs within a specified timeframe.
* **Weighting Non-financial Measures:** A material weight must be given to non-financial measures in remuneration performance assessments. This helps ensure that remuneration is not solely driven by short-term financial results and promotes a more balanced approach to risk management.
* **Downward Adjustments Based on Risk Conduct:** Variable remuneration should be adjusted downwards, potentially to zero, based on clearly defined risk criteria. This helps to disincentivize risky behavior and ensure that remuneration is commensurate with the risks taken.
* **Mitigating Conflict of Interest:** Banks must take reasonable steps to assess and mitigate conflicts of interest when designing remuneration arrangements. This may involve deferring variable remuneration and applying appropriate service contract terms.
* **Transparency and Disclosure:** Banks must make clear, comprehensive, and comparable public disclosures about their remuneration frameworks and practices. This enhances transparency and accountability, promoting greater market discipline.

By implementing these requirements, banks can create remuneration structures that encourage prudent risk management and long-term sustainability."

You should allow time for their assessment processes.",I don't have information about applying for an ARPA licence.
37,I want to register a company name with an APRA regulate restricted term. How do I do this?,"Once you have lodged your application with APRA you should advise APRA in writing of the specific company name that you want to register and request APRA s consent if the name includes an APRA regulated restricted term. APRA regulated restricted terms include the words Ãbank , Ãbanker , Ãbanking , Ãbuilding society , Ãcredit union , Ãcredit society  and Ãfriendly society . If you want to register a company name that uses the restricted words in section 66 of the Banking Act 1959 (such as the words Ãbank , Ãbanker  and Ãbanking ), please also refer to the APRA s Restricted Words under the Banking Act 1959 Guidelines: If consent is granted by APRA, it will usually be subject to conditions, such as not using the company name publicly prior to licensing. It is an offence for a person to use a restricted word or expression under section 66 in relation to a financial business, except where APRA has granted a consent or exemption, or where a statutory exception applies.

If you want to register a company name that uses the restricted term Ãfriendly society  you will need to apply for consent from APRA under section 16E of the Life Insurance Act 1995.

",I don't have information about registering a company name with an APRA regulate restricted term.
38,Can APRA provide further guidance beyond CPS and GPG220 Risk Management as to what should be included in the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS)?,"What is a RAS?The RAS is a document that provides boundaries within which both management and staff know how it is acceptable to operate. It provides ground rules which should be very clear for management in terms of what they are, and are not, allowed to do in pursuit of the institution s business strategy and objectives. Without such boundaries and ground rules, management (and ultimately all staff) may be unaware that they are operating outside of the risk appetite set by the Board.  How should the RAS be structured? APRA does not prescribe the structure or form of your RAS and you are generally free to adopt a risk appetite that suits the particular circumstances of your business, within the requirements of the prudential standards.A RAS should be a concise document and should not include all management reporting. It is unlikely that a RAS would need to have an appendix as it would not be expected that there would be ancillary information in a RAS.  What content should be covered in the RAS? The RAS should cover both high-level qualitative statements and, where appropriate, quantitative measures, which combined clearly capture your attitude towards, and level of acceptance of, its different risks. The RAS should consider the material risks to your company as well as to your reputation with policyholders/depositors, investors and customers. The RAS should also closely align with your strategic direction.Qualitative statements should set the overall tone for your approach to risk taking and should also clearly articulate the Board s motivations for taking on or avoiding certain types of risks or exposures. In this way, qualitative statements advise stakeholders of your attitude toward risk taking by placing high-level boundaries around the types of activities you are prepared to undertake.Qualitative statements are likely where a hard boundary for operations is being set rather than a metric with variables or a scale.How do we demonstrate that the RAS has/will be applied? Your business strategy and policies should operate in line with your RAS. Once the Board has approved your RAS, you should be able to evidence decisions being made in line with it.Additionally, as the RAS needs to be used by a number of stakeholders consistently across all of your business operations it must be easy to communicate and written in plain English. A RAS which is not easily understood will be difficult to embed throughout your organisation, as staff will not know how they are expected to behave and what they are permitted to do in order to operate within the risk appetite. * Information contained in this section is a summary of all information available from APRA including Information Papers, letters to industry and speeches. The questions and answers are designed to clarify CPS 220 Risk Management but do not form part of the law or create enforceable requirements.

39,What is required in the external auditor's verification of minimum captial?,"APRA requires the applicant to provide written verification from its appointed external auditor that it meets the minimum regulatory capital level required prior to licensing. This must include meeting the applicable minimum level of capital and capital ratios. The written verification should set out the steps taken by the external auditor in making the verification, including the calculation of minimum capital requirements where applicable. For life insurers, the verification should address the solvency of each statutory fund, as well as the minimum capital requirements and capital ratios for each of its statutory funds and the life company as a whole. RSE applicants are required to attach an audited copy of the applicant s statement of financial position for the last two years to their applications, but do not need a separate verification of solvency.

The market risk policy/ies should also specifically state that the ADI will not undertake any proprietary trading business if this is the case. 

","Yes, even if your business won't have a trading desk, you still need policies covering market risks.  

The context you provided highlights the importance of a comprehensive risk management framework, including policies addressing market risks, for any financial institution.  This is true regardless of whether you engage in active trading or not. 

Here's why:

* **Market risks are inherent in any financial operation:** Even if you don't have a dedicated trading desk, you are still exposed to market risks. For example, interest rate fluctuations can impact your lending and borrowing activities, changes in exchange rates can impact your international operations, and commodity price movements can affect your supply chain or investment holdings. 
* **APRA guidelines emphasize a holistic risk management approach:**  APRA's prudential standards require financial institutions to have a robust risk management framework that addresses all material risks, including market risks. This framework should include policies, procedures, and controls to identify, measure, monitor, and manage these risks.
* **Failing to manage market risks can lead to serious consequences:**  Uncontrolled market risks can lead to significant financial losses, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and even insolvency. 

Therefore, even without a trading desk, it is crucial for your business to develop and implement policies that cover market risks. These policies should be tailored to your specific business model and risk profile and should be subject to regular review and updates."
42,"As a restricted ADI/ADI applicant, when do I need to provide information about compliance with the Bank Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR)?","The BEAR regime applies to Restricted ADI/ADIs and imposes notification obligations to APRA on compliance with the BEAR regime. Templates for these notification obligations, including accountability statements and accountability maps, are available on the APRA website and will need to be completed as a pre-licence requirement. The time frame for reporting changes of 14 calendar days applies to RADIs as well as ADIs.",I don't have information about the Bank Executive Accountability Regime (BEAR) in the provided context.
43,How should securitisation  warehouse funding risks be addressed?,"Start-up ADIs are often reliant on securitisation warehouse facilities to quickly build lending volumes. For start-up ADIs reliant on securitisation warehouse facilities (e.g. greater than 20 per cent of funding in any projected year), APRA expects the warehouse facility to be automatically placed into amortisation if the warehouse facility is not renewed.  Where this occurs, this will be considered long-term wholesale funding and will not add to the minimum MLH requirement. This approach reduces the risk that the reliance on warehouse facilities would result in a situation where the new ADI either has to transfer the mortgages to the warehouse provider, who may replace the new ADI as servicer or sell the mortgages to another party, or take the assets back on balance sheet at the end of the contractual term if the facility is not renewed. These scenarios would likely threaten the viability of the start-up ADI, as it is unlikely to have sufficient funding to repay the facility, and loss of mortgages will eliminate servicing income and retained equity in the warehoused mortgages.  
",I don't have information about how securitisation warehouse funding risks should be addressed.
44,Is there a minimum expectation in regard to operating captial at the point of licensing?,"Yes, in addition to the expectation that Restricted ADIs must hold capital of at least $3 million plus a resolution reserve (typically $1 million), APRA expects a Restricted ADI to have sufficient operating capital to enable the entity to cover expenses and planned lending for typically the first three months after licensing. This may vary where appropriate, for example where an applicant has a profitable existing business. This operating capital would reduce the pressure on Restricted ADIs to raise money immediately after licensing and help ensure that the Restricted ADI has the resources it needs to operationalise during the restricted period. ",I don't have information about a minimum expectation in regard to operating capital at the point of licensing.
45,Are Restricted ADIs required to conduct some elements of banking business during the restricted phase?,"Yes, Restricted ADIs are expected to carry out some elements of banking business (i.e. at least one deposit or lending product) during the restricted phase. The Information Paper states on page 22 that APRA expects Restricted ADIs to be conducting limited business during the restricted phase. APRA strongly re-inforces this expectation. This will result in significant benefits to both the applicant and APRA, as set out below: -ensures the Restricted ADI is building both staff and operational capabilities during the restricted phase; -provides the Restricted ADI with an opportunity to test its business proposition with customers; -demonstrates to investors and potential investors that the applicant can launch a product and attract customers, which should assist the applicant in raising capital; and -allows APRA to assess the ability of the Restricted ADI to launch and manage products, providing a more informed assessment of risk management capabilities.","Yes, according to the context, Restricted ADIs are **confined to providing purchased payment facilities** during the restricted phase.  This means they are limited in the banking business they can conduct.  They are subject to the condition of authority under Section 12A of the Banking Act."
46,Does my entity need to comply with all of the Prudential Standards?,"Yes, your entity will need to comply with all of the applicable Prudential Standards. You should complete self-assessments against the requirements of the Prudential Standards. A self-assessment consists of a paragraph by paragraph review of the requirements of the prudential standard and cross references the relevant clause in your policies or otherwise contains an explanation as to why a requirement is not applicable. The purpose of the self-assessment is to enable management and the Board to gain comfort that the entity will meet the requirements or alternatively highlight areas of non-compliance that may lead to further discussions with APRA. APRA may ask to see your self-assessments. In the event that your entity is unable to meet a prudential requirement, there may be exceptional circumstances where APRA will consider a request to adjust or exclude a requirement, for example where the proposed business model is substantially different to existing models and it is not possible under this business model to comply with the requirement. You should be aware that a request to adjust or exclude a requirement of the Prudential Standard will likely add further time to the licence application due to the need to consider the proposal, including the impact on desired prudential outcomes and the precedent it would set. A request for an adjustment or exclusion of a requirement may not be approved. You should factor in time for the review of any request and have a contingency plan if the request is not granted.",The provided context indicates that an **apraregulated institution** must comply with all of the Prudential Standards in their entirety unless otherwise expressly indicated.
47,What is APRA's role in reviewing policies/documents?,"APRA reviews documents to assess adherence to and understanding of prudential standards, as well as to obtain a view in regard to the competency of your staff. APRA does not approve the individual policies, as ensuring the policies are suitable for your entity is the responsibility of the Board and management. APRA will seek to ensure that the policies meet the necessary prudential requirements and that APRA has confidence that they can be implemented effectively ahead of granting a licence.","APRA has a significant role in reviewing policies and documents. 

**APRA's role in reviewing policies/documents:**

* **Prudential Standard:** APRA sets prudential standards, which are guidelines and requirements that regulated entities must follow. APRA reviews policies and documents to ensure they comply with these standards.
* **Risk Management:** APRA reviews policies and documents related to risk management, including business continuity plans, outsourcing arrangements, and credit risk management. 
* **Auditing:** APRA may require regulated entities to appoint an auditor to provide a report on specific aspects of their operations, such as their prudential reporting, risk management system, and financial position.
* **Data Collection:** APRA collects data from regulated entities to monitor their financial health and the overall financial system. They review the data collection policies and processes to ensure accuracy and reliability.
* **Reporting Requirements:** APRA establishes reporting standards that require regulated entities to provide information on a regular basis. They review the reporting forms and instructions to ensure they are clear and comprehensive.
* **Special Purpose Engagement:** APRA can request special purpose engagements from auditors to review particular aspects of a regulated entity's operations, such as their credit risk management or provisioning practices.

**Examples of APRA's review of policies/documents:**

* Reviewing a bank's business continuity plan to ensure it meets APRA's requirements for business continuity management.
* Reviewing a credit risk management policy to ensure it complies with APRA's credit risk management standards.
* Reviewing a reporting form to ensure it captures the required data and is presented in a clear and consistent manner.
* Requiring an audit of an insurance company's risk management system to assess its effectiveness.

In summary, APRA's role in reviewing policies and documents is crucial for ensuring the safety and soundness of the Australian financial system."
48,What does APRA do?,"The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is the prudential regulator of the financial services industry. It oversees banks, mutuals, general insurance and reinsurance companies, life insurance, private health insurers, friendly societies, and most members of the superannuation industry.

Its primary functions include Regulation and Supervision, Financial Stability, Consumer Protection, Prudential Standards, and Crisis Management.","APRA stands for the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. It is established by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act. APRA is responsible for prudential supervision of the Australian financial services industry, including banks, insurance companies, superannuation funds, and other financial institutions. This involves setting prudential standards, monitoring and supervising financial institutions, and taking action to ensure their financial soundness and stability."
49,How does APRA regulate bank lending safety?,"APRA also undertakes regular reviews and assessments of regulated entities. If APRA identifies any risks during the supervision process, it will intervene early to find a solution before an entity's ability to meet its financial obligations to its customers is threatened.","APRA, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, regulates bank lending safety in several ways.  Here are some key examples:

* **Lending Limits:**  APRA may set limits on specific types of lending, such as residential mortgages, investment loans, or commercial property loans.  This helps prevent excessive risk build-up in the banking system and ensure that banks have the capacity to manage their lending.  Limits may be based on factors like loan-to-value ratios (LVR), debt-to-income ratios (DTI), and loan purpose.

* **Provisioning Requirements:**  APRA may require banks to hold a certain level of provisions (also known as bad debt reserves) to cover potential losses on loans. This helps ensure banks have sufficient financial resources to absorb losses during economic downturns.  

* **Credit Risk Management:**  APRA establishes standards for credit risk management practices, requiring banks to have policies, processes, and practices in place to assess, monitor, and manage the risks associated with lending.  APRA may also conduct special purpose engagements, such as independent reviews, to assess the effectiveness of these practices.

* **Capital Adequacy:**  APRA sets capital adequacy requirements for banks to ensure they have enough capital to absorb potential losses.  These requirements include provisions for credit risk, interest rate risk, and operational risk.

* **Reporting Requirements:**  APRA requires banks to report a wide range of financial information, including lending data, asset quality, and capital levels.  This information helps APRA monitor banks' financial health and identify potential risks early.

* **Resolvability Assessments:**  APRA requires banks to have resolvability assessments, which are plans for how the bank can be safely wound down in case of failure.  These assessments help ensure that the bank can be resolved without causing significant disruption to the financial system.

In summary, APRA uses a combination of regulatory tools, including limits, requirements, and oversight to ensure that banks in Australia are lending safely and prudently."
50,how does APRA regulate Consumer Protection?,"APRA's remit involves regulating financial entities in accordance with the prudential laws of the Commonwealth, setting prudential standards for those entities, monitoring compliance with those laws and standards through day-to-day supervision, and intervening early to resolve issues.","I don't have information about how APRA regulates consumer protection.

It sets the prudential standards that insurance companies must comply with, ensuring their financial soundness and protecting policyholders' interests. 

APRA's specific roles in regulating insurance companies include:

* **Setting prudential standards:** APRA develops and enforces prudential standards, such as capital adequacy requirements, investment limits, and risk management frameworks, to ensure insurance companies can meet their financial obligations to policyholders.
* **Supervising insurance companies:** APRA monitors insurance companies' financial performance, risk management practices, and compliance with prudential standards. This involves reviewing their financial reports, conducting onsite inspections, and engaging with their management teams.
* **Licensing and registration:** APRA grants licenses and registrations to insurance companies operating in Australia, ensuring they meet specific criteria and are fit to conduct insurance business.
* **Enforcing compliance:** APRA takes action against insurance companies that breach prudential standards or engage in misconduct, which can range from issuing warnings to imposing penalties and even revoking licenses.
* **Promoting financial stability:** APRA actively promotes a stable and resilient insurance industry by supporting responsible financial practices, overseeing the development of innovative products and services, and mitigating risks to the financial system. 

Through these regulatory activities, APRA ensures a safe and sound insurance sector in Australia, protecting policyholders from financial losses and fostering a strong and competitive market."
69,What Is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)?,The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) refers to the proportion of highly liquid assets that financial institutions must hold to ensure that they can meet their short-term obligations and ride out any disruptions in the market. It is mandated by international banking agreements known as the Basel Accords.,"The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is a key prudential standard in Australia, designed to ensure that Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs) have sufficient liquid assets to meet their obligations during a 30-day period of severe liquidity stress.  

Here's a breakdown of the LCR:

**Objective:**
The LCR aims to ensure ADIs have enough high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can be easily converted into cash to cover net cash outflows during a 30-day severe liquidity stress scenario. 

**Components:**
The LCR has two main components:

1. **Numerator:** This represents the value of the ADI's stock of HQLA under stressed conditions. 
2. **Denominator:** This represents the total net cash outflow, calculated based on a specific stress scenario.

**Calculation:**
The LCR is calculated by dividing the value of the stock of HQLA by the total net cash outflow:

* **LCR = Stock of HQLA / Total Net Cash Outflow**

The result is expressed as a percentage, and ADIs must maintain an LCR of at least 100%. 

**Key Features:**

* **HQLA:**  The HQLA must meet operational requirements, meaning it must be readily available for sale or repurchase to generate cash. There are specific categories of assets that qualify as HQLA, including government bonds, central bank reserves, and certain types of corporate debt.
* **Stress Scenario:**  The LCR calculation involves a specific stress scenario, which is outlined in the APRA guidelines. This scenario assumes a significant decline in market liquidity and a surge in customer withdrawals.
* **Net Cash Outflow:**  The net cash outflow is calculated by subtracting expected cash inflows from expected cash outflows.  The guidelines outline specific categories of liabilities and assets that are used to calculate these cash flows.
* **Buffer:**  ADIs must maintain an appropriate buffer of HQLA above the minimum requirement, reflecting their liquidity risk tolerance and other factors.

**APRA's Role:**

APRA monitors ADIs' LCR positions and may impose additional requirements if they are concerned about an ADI's liquidity risk profile or the quality of their liquidity risk management."

71,What is the Prudential Standard CPS 234?,"CPS 234 aims to reduce cyber risk and improve cybersecurity by requiring that APRA-regulated entities maintain an information security capability commensurate with their information security vulnerabilities and threats, and employ vendor risk management practices to reduce the likelihood and impact of incidents involving related or third-parties.  ",I don't have information about the specific content of Prudential Standard CPS 234.
72,What happens if an institution fails to meet APRAs capital requirements?,"Any breach of the required minimum ratios is a very significant prudential concern and would signal deficiencies in financial management or underlying financial soundness. As a result, APRA takes swift action on any potential breaches of minimum capital requirements.","If an institution fails to meet APRA's capital requirements, they must notify APRA of the breach or prospective breach, and inform APRA of the remedial action taken or planned to deal with the breach. They must also inform APRA as soon as practicable of any significant departure from their internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) or any indication of significant adverse changes to market pricing or trading of capital instruments."

76,What are APRAs stress testing requirements for banks?,"The starting point in developing a stress test is to design the scenarios. This is the foundation of the exercise, and it is important that scenarios are calibrated effectively and are well targeted. For industry stress tests, APRA collaborates with both the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) on the design of scenarios and the economic parameters that define them. In 2017, APRA also engaged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in the design of the operational risk scenario.

Scenarios should be aligned to the purpose of the exercise. At a high level, these are guided within APRA by several objectives  namely to:

assess system-wide and entity-specific resilience to severe but plausible scenarios;
improve stress testing capabilities across the industry; and
support the identification and assessment of core and emerging risks.
In line with these objectives, APRA developed two scenarios for the 2017 industry stress test. The first was a macroeconomic scenario with a China-led recession in Australia and New Zealand. This was considered the most severe but plausible adverse economic scenario for the banking system at the time.[1] In this scenario, there was assumed to be a fall in Australian GDP of 4 per cent, while house prices declined 35 per cent nationally over three years. The chart below provides an indication of the severity of the scenario: it shows that the assumed peak unemployment rate in the scenario was similar to the 1990s recession in Australia, the United States experience in the global financial crisis (GFC), as well as recent overseas regulatory stress tests.","APRA's stress testing requirements for banks are outlined in the prudential standard ""APS 220 Stress Testing"" which addresses the following:

* **Purpose of Stress Testing:** The primary goals of stress testing are to evaluate a bank's capacity to absorb potential large losses and identify steps to reduce risk and conserve capital.
* **Scope of Stress Testing:** The stress testing program must reflect the bank's specific risk characteristics and portfolio. It must combine supervisory stress scenarios with internally developed stress tests.
* **Scenarios:** Stress testing scenarios must include severe and plausible adverse conditions that consider factors like severe market conditions, illiquidity, and price concentration.
* **Granularity:** Banks must conduct stress testing at a granular level that allows for adequate sensitivity to different risk characteristics and exposure types.
* **Analysis and Reporting:** The analysis must include contingency plans for potential board and senior management actions in response to various scenarios. Additionally, the stress testing program must be well-documented and include information on scenarios, key assumptions, results, and capital impacts.
* **Validation:** The stress testing model must be appropriately validated and checked independently by appropriately qualified external parties.
* **Regular Review:** Banks must establish a system for independent and regular reviews of their credit risk management processes and practices. The results of these reviews must be communicated directly to the board and senior management.

In addition to these general requirements, APRA may set specific limits on exposure categories for banks that are deemed to be taking on excessive credit risk relative to their financial and operational capacity.

It's important to note that this is a summary of APRA's stress testing requirements, and the full details are available in the relevant prudential standard, APS 220."
77,What is RWA?,"Risk-weighted asset is a bank's assets or off-balance-sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. This sort of asset calculation is used in determining the capital requirement or Capital Adequacy Ratio for a financial institution.","RWA stands for **Risk-Weighted Asset**.  It is a measure of a bank's capital adequacy, calculated according to specific prudential standards like APRA's Prudential Standard APS 111 Capital adequacy: standardised approach to credit risk.  

RWA is used to determine the amount of capital a bank needs to hold against its credit risk. This is calculated by applying a risk weight to the bank's assets, with higher risk weights being applied to assets that are considered more risky. The resulting RWA figure is then used to calculate the bank's capital adequacy ratio."
