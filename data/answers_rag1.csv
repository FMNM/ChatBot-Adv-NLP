1,"What is the main purpose of the Basel III regulatory framework, as implemented in Australia?","The Basel III capital reforms are international banking supervisorsÃ response to deficiencies in the regulatory capital framework identified during the global financial crisis. These reforms were endorsed prior to release by the G20, of which Australia is a member. APRA, as a member of the Basel Committee, played an active role in formulating the Basel III measures. ","The main purpose of the Basel III regulatory framework, as implemented in Australia, is to **enhance the resilience of banks and the banking system**.  This is achieved through measures that aim to:

* **Strengthen capital requirements**:  This ensures that banks have enough capital to absorb losses during periods of financial stress.
* **Improve liquidity**:  This ensures that banks can meet their obligations, even in times of market disruption.
* **Reduce leverage**:  This limits the amount of debt banks can take on, reducing their exposure to risk.
* **Improve risk management**:  This encourages banks to have sound and effective risk management frameworks. 
* **Increase transparency**:  This promotes greater disclosure of financial information, enhancing market discipline."
2,Can you explain the difference between an Australian Deposit-Taking Institution (DTI) and a Non-Deposit Taking Institution (NDTI)?,"An Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs) is an Australian government term for financial institutions in Australia which are supervised by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and authorised to accept deposits from the public.Whereas a non-deposit taking institution is a financial institution that does not have a full banking license or is not supervised by a national regulatory authority. These type of lenders are generally privately funded and do not have the normal features of a deposit taking institution (i.e. you cannot use an offset account as they have no facility to hold your funds). Generally it is the non-deposit taking institutions which will offer a non-conforming loan product. A non-conforming loan is a loan that fails to meet bank criteria for funding. This may include situations where the borrower has just started up a business and has a short trading history, has a poor credit history, or an ATO tax debt to be paid off.","The provided text defines an Authorised Deposit-Taking Institution (ADI) as a corporation that is regulated by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) under the Banking Act. The text does not specify what a Non-Deposit Taking Institution (NDTI) is. Therefore, I am unable to provide an explanation of the difference between the two."
3,How do Australian banks report their exposure to credit risk using the Internal Ratings-Based Approach (IRB)?,"IRB banks must compare regulatory expected losses (which are derived from their estimates of PD, LGD and EAD) against provisions held for credit losses and deduct any shortfall in provisions from the capital base. This leads to an increase in the capital requirement.","The provided text does not contain information about how Australian banks report their exposure to credit risk using the Internal Ratings-Based Approach (IRB). The text focuses on the reporting requirements for Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and the various forms and standards that Australian banks must use for reporting data.

To find information on how Australian banks report their exposure to credit risk using IRB, you should consult the APRA's Prudential Standard APS 210 *Capital Adequacy: Internal Ratings-Based Approach*  and APRA's Prudential Standard APS 110 *Capital Adequacy: Standardised Approach*."
4,What is the definition of a Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) under Australian prudential regulations?,"The Ãtoo-big-to-failÃ problem refers to the fact that certain financial institutions, because of their size and/or interconnectedness, could pose a material risk to financial stability and the real economy if they were to fail. Such institutions are referred to as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs).","The provided text does not define a Systemically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) under Australian prudential regulations. Therefore, I cannot answer your question."
5,How do Australian banks calculate their Basel III capital requirements for Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital?,"The capital adequacy ratio is calculated by adding tier 1 capital to tier 2 capital and dividing by risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is the core capital of a bank, which includes equity capital and disclosed reserves. This type of capital absorbs losses without requiring the bank to cease its operations; tier 2 capital is used to absorb losses in the event of a liquidation.
Under Basel III, a banks tier 1 and tier 2 minimum capital adequacy ratio (including the capital conservation buffer) must be at least 10.5% of its risk-weighted assets (RWA). That combines the total capital requirement of 8% with the 2.5% capital conservation buffer. The capital conservation buffer recommendation is designed to build up banks capital, which they could use in periods of stress.","The provided text focuses on the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority's (APRA) prudential standards and guidelines for capital adequacy, but it does not provide details on how Australian banks calculate their Basel III capital requirements for Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. 

To answer your question, it would be necessary to have access to APRA's prudential standards that explicitly detail the calculation methods for Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital under the Basel III framework. This information is beyond the scope of the text provided."
6,Can you explain the concept of Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under Australian prudential regulations?,The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) refers to the proportion of highly liquid assets that financial institutions must hold to ensure that they can meet their short-term obligations and ride out any disruptions in the market. It is mandated by international banking agreements known as the Basel Accords.,"The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is a key prudential requirement under Australian banking regulations, designed to ensure that Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs) maintain adequate levels of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to meet their short-term liquidity needs during a severe liquidity stress scenario. 

Here's a breakdown of the LCR concept under Australian prudential regulations:

**Objective:** The LCR aims to ensure ADIs have sufficient unencumbered HQLA, which can be readily converted to cash, to cover their net cash outflows over a 30-day time period during a severe liquidity stress scenario. This scenario is defined by APRA and includes a range of factors like market-wide stress, institution-specific stress, and protracted stress.

**Calculation:** The LCR has two components:

* **Numerator:** This represents the value of the stock of HQLA held by the ADI at the start of the 30-day stress period.
* **Denominator:** This represents the total net cash outflow calculated according to scenario parameters set out in APRA's prudential standard.

**Requirement:** The LCR must be at least 100%, meaning that ADIs must hold HQLA equal to or greater than their projected net cash outflows over the 30-day stress period. 

**HQLA:** HQLA is categorized into two tiers:

* **HQLAa:**  These are the highest quality liquid assets, including central bank reserves and government bonds with a residual maturity of less than one year.
* **HQLAb:**  These are assets that have a slightly lower liquidity profile than HQLAa, subject to specific haircuts (deductions) in the LCR calculation.

**Stress Testing:**  ADIs are required to conduct regular stress tests using various scenarios to identify potential liquidity strains and ensure they have sufficient HQLA and liquidity risk tolerance to manage these events. 

**Buffer:** The LCR requirement of 100% is a minimum.  ADIs are expected to hold an appropriate buffer of HQLA above this minimum to accommodate potential liquidity risks and maintain a safe and sound financial position.

**Consequences of a Breach:**  If an ADI experiences a breach of the LCR requirement, it must inform APRA immediately and outline the remedial actions taken or planned to restore its liquidity position.

**Key Points to Remember:**

* The LCR is a vital element of APRA's prudential framework for managing liquidity risk.
* It requires ADIs to maintain a sufficient stock of HQLA to withstand short-term liquidity shocks.
* The calculation involves a 30-day stress scenario and includes specific haircuts for various asset types.
* Stress testing and a buffer above the 100% minimum requirement are key components of sound liquidity management."
7,What are the key elements of a risk management framework under Australian banking regulations?,"An overarching risk management policy
An overview of the entityÃs approach to managing risk
Effective risk management frameworks generally describe the risk management processes to be used in the entity. This may include a common process for the assessment and management of individual risks including:
risk identification - how and when risks are identified,
risk assessment - how risks are assessed (likelihood, consequence, vulnerability, speed of onset etc), and
risk treatment - the entityÃs approach for treating risks (mitigate, share, transfer, accept etc).
Key risk management responsibilities
In line with element four of the Commonwealth Risk Management Policy, an entityÃs risk management framework should also clearly define the risk management responsibilities of officials, including the following:
Accountable Authority
Chief Risk Officer (if applicable)
Senior Executives
Audit Committee
Risk Committee (if applicable)
The risk management function
Risk owners
Control owners
Treatment owners
All staff
How the entity will report risks to both internal and external stakeholders
The attributes of the risk management culture that the entity seeks to develop
How the risk management framework and entity risk profile will be periodically reviewed and improved
The approach for measuring risk management performance
How the entity contributes to managing any shared or cross jurisdictional risks
An overview of the entityÃs approach to embedding risk management into its existing business processes","The key elements of a risk management framework under Australian banking regulations are:

* **Risk Appetite Statement**:  A clear and concise statement outlining the level of risk the institution is willing to accept in pursuit of its strategic objectives, taking into account the interests of depositors and/or policyholders.
* **Risk Management Strategy (RMS)**: A document outlining the strategy for managing risk, including material risks identified, approaches to managing them, relevant policies and procedures, and responsibilities for risk management.
* **Business Plan**: A written plan outlining the institution's approach to implementing its strategic objectives. This plan must be reviewed annually, considering material risks associated with the objectives and any potential changes affecting the institution's risk profile.
* **Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)**:  A process for assessing, measuring, reporting, and managing material risk across the institution, including stress testing and scenario analysis.
* **Management Information System (MIS)**:  A robust data framework that enables the aggregation of risk exposures across business lines and the prompt reporting of any limit breaches.
* **Risk Management Function**: An operationally independent function with the necessary authority and reporting lines to the board, board committees, and senior management. This function should be appropriately sized and staffed to manage the institution's risks effectively.
* **Policy and Procedures**: Clear and documented policies and procedures that support the risk management framework and address all material risk types, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, insurance risk, operational risk, and risks arising from strategic objectives and the business plan.

These elements collectively ensure that an institution is prudently and soundly managed, regardless of its size, business mix, or operational complexity."
8,How do Australian banks report their capital adequacy requirements to APRA?,"
Australian banks report their capital adequacy requirements to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) primarily through the quarterly and annual reporting of capital adequacy and risk-weighted assets (RWA) data. The APRA monitors this data as part of its prudential supervision to ensure banks maintain sufficient capital to absorb losses while protecting depositors and maintaining financial stability. HereÃs a breakdown of the reporting process:

Prudential Standard APS 110: APRA requires banks to meet capital adequacy standards set by the Prudential Standard APS 110 (Capital Adequacy), which aligns with the Basel III framework. This standard outlines minimum capital ratios banks must maintain, including the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1, and Total Capital ratios.

Regular Reporting Requirements:

Quarterly and Annual Reports: Banks submit detailed reports on their capital positions and risk exposures, which include the composition of capital, RWA, and calculations of their capital ratios.
Reporting Forms: These submissions are standardized through APRAÃs reporting forms (such as ARF 110.0 for capital adequacy and ARF 112.0 for RWA). Banks complete these forms using APRAÃs Data Collection Solution (D2A), and APRA recently transitioned to the APRA Connect system for enhanced data collection.
Disclosures and Stress Testing: APRA also requires larger banks to disclose their capital adequacy publicly, which increases transparency. They may also conduct periodic stress tests, where banks report on their capital adequacy under hypothetical stress scenarios to assess resilience.

Supervisory Review: APRA conducts supervisory reviews of these submissions to ensure compliance and may engage in direct discussions with banks to assess their capital positions and risk management practices.

This process allows APRA to monitor and enforce capital requirements while enabling it to act swiftly in response to financial risks affecting the banking system.","Australian banks are required to report their capital adequacy requirements to APRA using a specific reporting form (ARF) designated for that purpose. This form is a key component of the prudential reporting requirements set by APRA for Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs).

The information required for the capital adequacy reporting includes:

* **Risk-based regulatory capital ratio:** This ratio is calculated by dividing the ADI's common equity tier capital, additional tier 1 capital, and tier 1 capital by its total risk-weighted assets (RWA). 
* **Capital floor:** This is a minimum requirement for the common equity tier capital, which ensures that ADIs maintain a strong level of core capital.
* **Capital conservation buffer:** This is an additional requirement for common equity tier capital, which provides a cushion during periods of financial stress.
* **Countercyclical capital buffer:** This is an additional requirement for common equity tier capital, which is designed to mitigate systemic risk by increasing capital requirements during periods of economic expansion.
* **Minimum dollar amount of capital:** This is a minimum requirement for the common equity tier capital, which is set to ensure that ADIs have sufficient capital to cover their operational needs.
* **Minimum leverage ratio requirement:** This ratio measures the ADI's capital against its total assets, which is designed to mitigate systemic risk by ensuring that ADIs have a minimum level of capital relative to their total assets.

The capital adequacy reporting form is submitted electronically to APRA using a direct application method (DA). The due date for this reporting is subject to specific deadlines set by APRA, typically on a quarterly basis. 

The information collected on the capital adequacy reporting form is used by APRA to:

* **Monitor the financial health of ADIs.**
* **Assess their compliance with capital adequacy regulations.**
* **Identify potential systemic risks in the financial system.**
* **Support prudential oversight and supervision of the banking sector.**"
9,Can you explain the concept of Operational Risk under Australian prudential regulations?,"Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss (including to policy owners) resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events.","The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. 

APRA expects regulated entities to effectively manage operational risk and to set and maintain appropriate standards of conduct and compliance, ensuring critical operations are maintained within acceptable tolerance levels. 

The key principles of operational risk management under APRA guidelines are:

* **Effective Management of Operational Risk:** Regulated entities must effectively manage operational risk, which includes setting and maintaining appropriate standards of conduct and compliance.
* **Prevention of Disruption:** Regulated entities must prevent disruptions to critical operations to the extent practicable and adapt processes and systems to continue operating within tolerance levels.
* **Prompt Restoration of Operations:** In the event of a disruption, the regulated entity must return to normal operations promptly.
* **Management of Service Provider Risks:** Regulated entities must rely on service providers only if they can ensure these providers continue to meet prudential obligations and effectively manage the associated risks.
* **Risk Management Framework:** Regulated entities must develop and maintain a robust risk management framework that covers aspects of operational risk assessment, risk profile, risk appetite, tolerance levels, internal control, and reporting and monitoring.
* **Business Continuity Planning:** Regulated entities must have business continuity plans (BCPs) in place to identify, manage, and respond to disruptions within tolerance levels. These plans must be regularly tested under severe and plausible scenarios.
* **Service Provider Arrangement Review:** The risk management framework must include a process for reviewing service provider arrangements.
* **Review of Operational Risk Management:** The entity must review operational risk management on a regular basis.
* **Board Responsibility:** The board of the regulated entity is ultimately accountable for the entity's operational risk management, including business continuity management and service provider arrangements.

Overall, APRA emphasizes the need for a comprehensive and proactive approach to operational risk management, focusing on prevention, mitigation, and resilience."
10,What is the definition of an Integrated Disclosure Framework (IDF) under Australian banking regulations?,"The integrated report is a concise communication about how an organisationÃs strategy, governance, performance and prospects, in the context of its external environment, lead to value creation over time. It drives high-quality corporate reporting and connectivity between financial statements and sustainability-related financial disclosures, and brings together information investors need to assess a companyÃs ability to create value over time. An integrated report should be prepared in accordance with the Integrated Reporting Framework (IR Framework), which is an IFRS Foundation resource.
","The provided text does not contain information about an Integrated Disclosure Framework (IDF) under Australian banking regulations. Therefore, I cannot answer your question."
11,How do Australian banks report their exposure to liquidity risk using the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)?,"Australian banks report their exposure to liquidity risk through the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under APRAÃs Prudential Standard APS 210 (Liquidity). The LCR is designed to ensure banks maintain adequate levels of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to withstand a 30-day liquidity stress scenario. HereÃs an overview of how the reporting works:

1. **Prudential Standard APS 210**: The LCR requirement is part of APRAÃs APS 210, which outlines standards for liquidity risk management. This standard requires banks to maintain an LCR of at least 100%, meaning they should hold enough HQLA to cover expected net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period.

2. **Monthly Reporting**:
   - **APRAÃs Reporting Forms**: Banks report their LCR metrics monthly to APRA using specific forms like ARF 210.1A, which captures details on HQLA holdings, cash outflows, and inflows.
   - **Calculation of the LCR**: Banks calculate their LCR by dividing the total value of HQLA by net cash outflows expected over a 30-day stress period. These net outflows include expected outflows minus expected inflows, as per APRAÃs defined parameters.

3. **Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures**:
   - **Quarterly Public Disclosures**: Large banks are required to publicly disclose their LCR on a quarterly basis, including a breakdown of HQLA and significant inflow/outflow categories. This transparency aims to boost market confidence in banksÃ liquidity positions.
   - **Additional Qualitative Information**: Banks often provide contextual information on liquidity risk management practices, including descriptions of the key drivers of their LCR ratios and any significant changes in the quarter.

4. **Daily Monitoring for Large Banks**: APRA requires large institutions to monitor their LCR on a daily basis. Although monthly reporting is standard, APRA may request daily data in times of financial stress for enhanced supervision.

5. **Stress Testing**: APRA conducts regular stress tests where banks are required to simulate liquidity stress scenarios and report how these would impact their LCR. These exercises help APRA assess the robustness of banksÃ liquidity management strategies.

This framework ensures Australian banks manage and report liquidity risk consistently, enabling APRA to monitor system-wide liquidity resilience and intervene if necessary.","The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is a key prudential standard in Australia that aims to ensure banks maintain enough high-quality liquid assets to meet their liquidity needs during a 30-day period of severe liquidity stress. Banks report their LCR exposure by:

* **Calculating the stock of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA):**  This includes eligible assets such as cash, government securities, and certain corporate debt securities, subject to haircuts based on their liquidity and risk.

* **Determining the total net cash outflow:**  This involves calculating the total expected cash outflow minus the total expected cash inflow over a 30-day period under a specified stress scenario.

* **Applying the LCR formula:** The LCR is calculated by dividing the stock of HQLA by the total net cash outflow. The minimum LCR requirement is 100%, meaning that a bank must have sufficient HQLA to cover at least 100% of its expected net cash outflows over the 30-day stress period.

The reporting requirements for LCR are outlined in the **Prudential Standard APS Liquidity** (APS Liquidity). Australian banks must provide APRA with the necessary data to calculate their LCR, including:

* **Stock of HQLA:** The value of HQLA held by the bank, categorized by asset type and maturity.
* **Net cash outflow:**  Details of the expected cash inflows and outflows under the specified stress scenario, categorized by liability type and maturity.

APRA may require banks to maintain a higher minimum LCR if they have concerns about their liquidity risk profile or the quality of their liquidity risk management."
12,Can you explain the concept of Credit Risk Management under Australian prudential regulations?,"Credit management is the process of deciding which customers to extend credit to and evaluating those customers creditworthiness over time. It involves setting credit limits for customers, monitoring customer payments and collections, and assessing the risks associated with extending credit to customers.","Australian prudential regulations, specifically the **Prudential Standard APS Credit Risk Management**, outline a comprehensive framework for managing credit risk.  Here's a breakdown of the key aspects:

**1. Credit Risk Management Framework:**

* **Core Principle:**  ADIs (Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions) must establish and maintain a sound credit risk management framework that encompasses all aspects of the credit lifecycle, including:
    * Credit Origination
    * Credit Assessment and Approval
    * Credit Administration, Measurement, Monitoring, and Control
    * Credit Risk Classification, Exposure, and Provisioning
    * Non-Performing and Restructured Exposure Management

**2. Key Components of the Framework:**

* **Credit Risk Appetite Statement:**  This statement articulates the level of credit risk an ADI is willing to accept. It defines the maximum risk tolerance and outlines the process for monitoring and managing compliance with the set appetite.
* **Credit Risk Management Strategy:** This document details the ADI's overarching approach to credit risk, outlining the objectives and policies guiding credit origination, assessment, and approval. It considers factors like:
    * Exposure type
    * Economic industry sector
    * Geographical location
    * Currency
    * Maturity
    * Target portfolio mix
* **Credit Risk Policy:**  This policy defines the specific procedures and processes for identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and mitigating credit risk across the entire credit lifecycle.  It should address:
    * Target market and portfolio mix
    * Pricing and non-price terms
    * Approval authority and limits
    * Overrides, waivers, and exceptions
    * Reporting requirements
    * Compliance with applicable laws and regulations
* **Credit Origination:**  ADIs must have a robust process for identifying and assessing the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, including:
    * Comprehensive assessment of creditworthiness
    * Due consideration of borrower integrity, reputation, and legal capacity
    * Evaluation of repayment capacity, considering potential changes in interest rates, income, and cash flow
    * Adequate information gathering
    *  Proper assessment of collateral and guarantees
* **Credit Assessment and Approval:** ADIs must establish sound criteria for credit assessment and approval that are commensurate with the nature, size, and complexity of the exposure.  This process should include:
    * Experienced credit judgment
    * Documented credit decisions
    * Oversight of third-party assessments
    * Clear identification of approval authority
* **Credit Administration, Measurement, Monitoring, and Control:** ADIs need to have effective systems and controls in place for:
    * Ongoing monitoring of individual exposures and the overall credit portfolio 
    * Accurate and timely identification of credit risk changes
    * Adequate provisioning for potential credit losses
    * Timely write-offs of non-performing exposures, aligned with realistic repayment recovery expectations
* **Non-Performing and Restructured Exposures:**  The framework must outline the process for managing non-performing and restructured exposures, including:
    * Clear definition of non-performing exposures, considering both on- and off-balance sheet exposures 
    * Regular review and reclassification of exposures based on performance
    * Prudent policies for restructuring exposures, ensuring they are well-documented and appropriate

**3. Special Provisions:**

* **Provisioning:**  ADIs must have adequate provisioning policies that are consistent with their credit risk profile and in accordance with the Australian Accounting Standards. This includes:
    * Determining appropriate provisioning levels for both performing and non-performing exposures
    * Regularly reviewing and updating provisioning levels 
* **Supervisory Limits:**  APRA may set limits on specific exposure categories or lending activities if it believes an ADI is taking excessive credit risk relative to its capacity to manage and absorb potential losses.
* **Special Purpose Engagement:**  APRA may require an ADI to appoint an independent party to review specific aspects of its credit risk management, such as its provisioning practices.

**Overall, the APS Credit Risk Management Standard requires ADIs to adopt a comprehensive and robust approach to managing credit risk, ensuring the safety and soundness of the financial system.** It encourages a proactive and ongoing process that involves both internal and external oversight."
13,What are the key elements of a Capital Adequacy Framework under Australian banking regulations?,"Under Australian banking regulations, the Capital Adequacy Framework, governed by APRA, is designed to ensure banks maintain sufficient capital to absorb losses, support depositor protection, and promote financial stability. The key elements of this framework include:

1. **Minimum Capital Requirements**:
   - **Tiered Capital Ratios**: APRA requires banks to meet minimum capital ratios as outlined in Prudential Standard APS 110 (Capital Adequacy), consistent with the Basel III framework. These include:
     - **Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)**: The highest-quality capital, consisting mainly of common shares and retained earnings.
     - **Tier 1 Capital**: CET1 plus additional Tier 1 capital instruments.
     - **Total Capital Ratio**: Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital, which includes subordinated debt and other forms of capital that can absorb losses.
   - **Capital Buffers**: Banks must maintain additional buffers above minimum ratios, including a **Capital Conservation Buffer** and, for larger banks, a **Countercyclical Capital Buffer** to protect against cyclical downturns.

2. **Risk-Weighted Assets (RWA)**:
   - Banks calculate their RWA based on the risk profile of their assets, where riskier assets receive higher weights. APRA requires banks to categorize their assets according to the level of credit, market, and operational risks they pose, which helps determine the capital needed to support these assets.

3. **Pillar 2 Ã Supervisory Review**:
   - APRA performs a **Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP)** under Pillar 2 to assess banksÃ internal capital adequacy and risk management processes. Based on its evaluation, APRA may impose additional capital requirements to cover risks specific to each institution beyond the Pillar 1 minimums.

4. **Pillar 3 Ã Market Discipline and Disclosure**:
   - Banks are required to disclose certain information regarding their capital adequacy and risk exposures on a regular basis under Pillar 3. These disclosures, which include capital ratios, RWA breakdowns, and descriptions of risk management practices, aim to increase transparency and market discipline by enabling stakeholders to assess a bankÃs risk and capital position.

5. **Stress Testing**:
   - APRA mandates regular stress testing as part of banksÃ internal capital adequacy assessments and also conducts industry-wide stress tests. These tests simulate adverse scenarios to evaluate the resilience of banksÃ capital positions and assess whether they hold sufficient capital to withstand economic shocks.

6. **Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP)**:
   - Each bank must have an ICAAP, which is a structured framework for assessing capital adequacy in relation to its risk profile and operational strategy. The ICAAP, submitted annually to APRA, includes capital planning, risk measurement, and scenario analysis to ensure sufficient capital levels are maintained under varying economic conditions.

The Capital Adequacy Framework, with its requirements for minimum capital ratios, RWA calculations, supervisory review, disclosure, stress testing, and ICAAP, provides APRA with a comprehensive approach to overseeing the capital strength and resilience of Australian banks.","The key elements of a Capital Adequacy Framework under Australian banking regulations, as outlined in the provided text, include: 

* **Minimum Risk-Based Capital Adequacy Requirement:** This requirement specifies the minimum level of capital that an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) must hold, calculated as a percentage of their risk-weighted assets (RWA). This is based on the Basel II and Basel III frameworks.
* **Capital Floor:** This requirement mandates that an ADI must hold a certain percentage of their RWA in Tier 1 capital, regardless of their risk profile. This is designed to ensure that all ADIs have a minimum level of high-quality capital. 
* **Capital Conservation Buffer:** This requirement compels ADIs to hold an additional buffer of common equity tier 1 capital. This buffer helps to ensure that ADIs have enough capital to withstand unexpected losses and maintain their solvency.
* **Countercyclical Capital Buffer:** This requirement necessitates that ADIs hold an additional buffer of common equity tier 1 capital during periods of economic expansion. The aim is to build a cushion of capital that can be drawn upon during periods of economic downturn. 
* **Minimum Dollar Amount of Capital:** This requirement imposes a minimum dollar amount of capital that an ADI must hold, regardless of their size or risk profile. This ensures that even smaller ADIs have sufficient capital to cover their operational expenses and potential losses.
* **Minimum Leverage Ratio Requirement:** This requirement necessitates that ADIs maintain a minimum leverage ratio, which is calculated as a percentage of their Tier 1 capital to their total exposure. This is designed to ensure that ADIs have enough capital to cover their leverage and manage their risks.
* **Reduction of Capital Notification Requirement:** This requirement dictates that ADIs must notify APRA before making any planned reductions to their capital. This is to ensure that APRA is aware of any potential changes to an ADI's capital position and can assess their impact on the institution's safety and soundness. 

These elements work together to form a comprehensive framework that ensures the stability and resilience of the Australian banking system. They aim to:

* **Reduce systemic risk:** By requiring ADIs to hold sufficient capital, the framework helps to reduce the likelihood of a financial crisis. 
* **Enhance market discipline:** The framework encourages market participants to monitor the capital adequacy of ADIs, which helps to ensure that they are operating prudently. 
* **Promote transparency:** The framework requires ADIs to publicly disclose information about their capital adequacy, which helps to increase transparency in the financial market."
14,How do Australian banks calculate their risk-weighted assets (RWA) under Basel III?,"
Banks calculate risk-weighted assets by multiplying the exposure amount by the relevant risk weight for the type of loan or asset. A bank repeats this calculation for all of its loans and assets, and adds them together to calculate total credit risk-weighted assets.",The provided text does not contain information about how Australian banks calculate their risk-weighted assets (RWA) under Basel III.
15,Can you explain the concept of Systemic Risk under Australian prudential regulations?,Systemic risk is the risk of financial system disruption so widespread or severe that it causes material damage to the real economy. ,The provided text does not contain any information about Systemic Risk under Australian prudential regulations.
16,Can you explain the concept of Disclosures for the identification of potential G-SIBs under Australian prudential regulations?,"Every year, a sample of international banks must provide information to the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS) for assessment against a set of indicators that identify potential Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs).","The prudential standard ""Prudential Standard APS Public Disclosure"" outlines requirements for Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs) in Australia to make public disclosures, including those related to the identification of potential Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs). 

**Disclosure Attachment H**, specifically, is dedicated to **Disclosure Identification of Potential G-SIBs**.  

This attachment requires ADIs to disclose information that could potentially identify them as a G-SIB, which is a bank whose failure could have a significant negative impact on the global financial system.  

The standard emphasizes that ADIs must disclose information consistently with the **scope, complexity, operations, sophistication, and risk management systems and processes** of their business. 

**Key elements of the disclosure include:**

* **Full details of the G-SIB indicator**, which is a quantitative measure used to assess whether a bank is likely to be a G-SIB. 
* **Any factors that may contribute to or detract from** the G-SIB indicator. 
* **A clear explanation of the methodology used** to calculate the G-SIB indicator and the factors considered.

The purpose of this disclosure requirement is to:

* **Contribute to transparency** within the financial market. 
* **Enhance market discipline**, as investors and regulators can assess the potential systemic risk associated with an ADI. 

By requiring ADIs to disclose information about potential G-SIB status, Australian prudential regulations promote a more robust and transparent financial system."
17,Can you explain the concept of Liquidity Risk under Australian prudential regulations?,"Liquidity risk is the possibility an institution will be unable to obtain funds, such as customer deposits or borrowed funds, at a reasonable price or within a necessary period to meet its financial obligations.","The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) defines **liquidity risk** as the risk that an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) will be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due, because of insufficient liquid assets. APRA guidelines on liquidity risk are set out in the Prudential Standard APS Liquidity.

This standard requires ADIs to adopt prudent practices in managing liquidity risk by maintaining adequate levels of liquidity to meet their obligations across a wide range of operating circumstances.  The standard also includes requirements for:

* **Risk Management Framework:** ADIs must develop and maintain a robust framework for measuring, monitoring, and managing liquidity risk commensurate with the nature, scale, and complexity of their operations.
* **Liquid Asset Portfolio:** ADIs must maintain a portfolio of liquid assets sufficient in size and quality to enable them to withstand severe liquidity stress.
* **Robust Funding Structure:** ADIs must maintain a funding structure that is appropriate to the size, business mix, and complexity of their operations.
* **Stress Testing:** ADIs are required to conduct stress tests on a regular basis to assess the impact of various liquidity stress scenarios.
* **Contingency Funding Plans:** ADIs must develop formal contingency funding plans that outline how they will manage liquidity shortfalls in stressed situations.
* **Public Disclosure:** ADIs must disclose information about their liquidity risk profile, risk management, and liquidity position to the public.

The key principles for managing liquidity risk are:

* Maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet obligations as they fall due.
* Holding a minimum level of liquid assets to survive severe liquidity stress.
* Ensuring that activities are funded from stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis.
* Informing APRA as soon as possible of any concerns about current or future liquidity position.
* Notifying APRA immediately if the ADI experiences severe liquidity stress."
18,Who are High-Risk Customers?,"High-risk customers are individuals or entities that pose a greater risk to a business or financial institution due to different factors. These factors may include a higher likelihood of involvement in illegal activities, financial instability, or a history of behavior that could lead to financial losses for the institution.

Financial institutions are required to identify high-risk customers for several reasons. One of the most important reasons is compliance with AML requirements and regulations. But what is AML compliance?","The provided text does not contain information about ""High-Risk Customers.""  Therefore, I am unable to answer your question."
19,What is the meaning of credit risk mitigation?,"Credit risk mitigation is a process by which a company reduces its exposure to credit risks. It involves assessing creditworthiness, monitoring credit profiles, and managing risks to prevent revenue loss, ensuring a healthy balance sheet and cash flows.","Credit risk mitigation refers to the techniques and strategies used to reduce the risk of loss associated with a borrower's inability to repay their debt obligations. These techniques can include:

* **Collateral:** This involves securing a loan with an asset, such as property or equipment, that the lender can seize and sell to recover losses if the borrower defaults.
* **Guarantees:** A guarantee is a promise by a third party to repay the debt if the borrower fails to do so. 
* **Credit Derivatives:** These are financial instruments that transfer credit risk from one party to another. Examples include credit default swaps and total return swaps.
* **Netting:** This involves combining multiple outstanding transactions between two counterparties, reducing the overall exposure and potential loss.
* **Early Intervention and Workout Programs:** These programs help to identify and manage problem exposures, such as nonperforming loans, to minimize losses.
* **Provisioning:** Setting aside funds to cover potential losses from nonperforming exposures. 

The specific techniques used will depend on the nature of the credit risk being mitigated and the risk appetite of the lender."
20,Do Australian banks have to report their exposure to interest rate risk?,"The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) requires banks to summarise and report on the extent of interest rate risk that they face. For the banking book, this is measured as the expected change in economic value from a 200 basis point increase in interest rates at all maturities.","Yes, Australian banks are required to report their exposure to interest rate risk. 

The **Reporting Standard AR - Interest Rate Risk Banking Book (IRRBB)** outlines the requirements for Authorized Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs) to provide information to APRA about their interest rate risk in the banking book.  

This reporting standard applies to all ADIs, with the exception of foreign ADIs that conduct trading book activity in foreign exchange and commodity positions."
21,How do you calculate risk-weighted assets in RWA?,"Banks calculate risk-weighted assets by multiplying the exposure amount by the relevant risk weight for the type of loan or asset. A bank repeats this calculation for all of its loans and assets, and adds them together to calculate total credit risk-weighted assets.","The provided text does not specify how to calculate risk-weighted assets (RWA). It details the different types of exposures, how they are calculated, and how they are used to determine capital requirements. 

However, the document does state that RWA is calculated in accordance with several prudential standards, including:

* **Prudential Standard APS Capital Adequacy (Standardised Approach) Credit Risk**
* **Prudential Standard APS Securitisation**
* **Prudential Standard APS Capital Adequacy (Internal Ratings-Based Approach) Credit Risk** 

Therefore, the specific method for calculating RWA would depend on the prudential standard applied and the specific exposure being assessed."
22,What is an aps 310 audit?,APS 310/3PS 310 requires the appointed auditor to provide two different levels of assurance over the reliability of a specific set of ADI Reporting Forms at the ADIs financial year-end.,"The provided text does not contain any information regarding an ""APS 310 Audit""."
23,What is the audit and assurance policy statement?,An Audit and Assurance Policy (AAP) is intended to set out a companys approach to assuring the quality of the information it reports to shareholders (and other stakeholders) beyond that contained within the financial statements.,"The provided text does not contain a specific statement titled ""Audit and Assurance Policy Statement."" However, it does mention several aspects of audit and assurance requirements for various entities. 

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Auditing for Authorised Deposit-Taking Institutions (ADIs)**

* **APRA's Role:** APRA sets the prudential standards and reporting requirements for ADIs.
* **External Auditor's Role:** External auditors must review and test the systems and processes used by ADIs to ensure the accuracy and reliability of information reported to APRA. 
* **Internal Audit Function:** ADIs must maintain an independent internal audit function. This function evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the ADI's financial risk management framework.
* **Reporting:** The appointed auditor for a level group must report to APRA, the Board, and the Board Audit Committee on a regular basis, including matters related to APRA data collection, internal controls, and compliance with prudential requirements.

**Auditing for Other Apra-Regulated Institutions**

* **Internal Audit Function:** Apra-regulated institutions must have an independent internal audit function. This function evaluates the adequacy and effectiveness of the institution's financial risk management framework, including its operational risk management framework. 
* **External Audit:** The institution's risk management framework is subject to internal and/or external audits at least annually. 
* **Independent Review:** The institution's risk management framework must also be subject to a comprehensive review by an operationally independent, trained, and competent person (potentially an external consultant) at least every three years.

**Key Points**

* The provided text emphasizes the importance of independent auditing and assurance for financial institutions regulated by APRA.
* The text outlines the responsibilities of both internal and external auditors in verifying the adequacy and effectiveness of risk management frameworks, compliance with prudential requirements, and the accuracy of data reported to APRA.
* These audits aim to ensure the safety and soundness of the financial system. 

While a formal ""Audit and Assurance Policy Statement"" is not explicitly provided, the text presents a detailed overview of the audit requirements for entities under APRA's oversight."
24,What is counterparty credit risk in derivatives?,Counterparty credit risk isÃthe risk arising from the possibility that the counterparty may default on amounts owned on a derivative transaction.Ã,"Counterparty credit risk in derivatives is the risk that a counterparty to a derivatives transaction will default on their obligations, resulting in a financial loss for the other party. This risk arises because derivatives are contracts that derive their value from the underlying asset, and the value of the derivative can change significantly over time, potentially leading to a large exposure for the counterparty."
25,What is concentration risk?,Concentration risk is the potential for a loss in value of an investment portfolio or a financial institution when an individual or group of exposures move together in an unfavorable direction. The implication of concentration risk is that it generates such a significant loss that recovery is unlikely.,"The provided text describes concentration risk as the risk arising from a large exposure to a single counterparty, group of connected counterparties, or a specific source of risk. This risk can arise from a variety of sources, such as commodity, currency, sector, geography, or funding source."
26,What measures for the management of interest rate risk can be used by an Organisation?,"Gap analysis, duration analysis and stimulation models are interest rate risk measurement techniques. Each institution should use at least one, and preferably a combination of these techniques in managing its interest rate risk exposure.","The provided text does not include a list of measures for the management of interest rate risk. However, it does mention the importance of managing interest rate risk, specifically within the context of the banking book. 

It states that APRA requires an Authorised Deposit-Taking Institution (ADI) to have a framework for managing, measuring, and monitoring the interest rate risk in their banking book. This is to ensure that the institution's capital is sufficient to cover potential losses arising from changes in interest rates. 

The text also emphasizes the importance of a robust system for measuring interest rate risk, which should be able to capture potential losses across a range of interest rate scenarios. This system should be reviewed and validated regularly to ensure that it remains accurate and appropriate. 

The text also mentions the following aspects of managing interest rate risk:

* **Repricing assumptions:** The repricing assumption is a key input in measuring interest rate risk. It is important to carefully consider the repricing date of banking book items and to make appropriate assumptions about how these items will reprice in the future.
* **Stress testing:** Stress testing is essential for identifying potential vulnerabilities in an ADI's interest rate risk profile. Stress testing should be conducted regularly and should include a range of scenarios, including changes in the level, slope, and shape of the yield curve. 
* **Capital requirement:** The text mentions that the interest rate risk banking book (IRRBB) capital requirement must be calculated at least quarterly to reflect the risk profile. This requirement is determined based on an internal model approach and must meet certain quantitative standards.

Overall, the text emphasizes that APRA expects ADIs to have a robust and comprehensive framework for managing interest rate risk. This framework should include processes for:

* Identifying and measuring interest rate risk
* Setting appropriate limits and tolerances for interest rate risk
* Monitoring and controlling interest rate risk
* Stress testing interest rate risk
* Determining the appropriate capital requirement for interest rate risk

While the text does not explicitly list specific measures for managing interest rate risk, it does provide valuable insights into the expectations and requirements that APRA has for ADIs in this area."
27,How must banks assess and manage risks associated with outsourcing arrangements according to CPS 231?,All risks arising from outsourcing material business activities must be appropriately managed to ensure that the APRA-regulated entity is able to meet both its financial and service obligations to its depositors and/or policyholders. notify APRA after entering into agreements to outsource material business activities.,"According to CPS 231, APRA-regulated institutions must:

* **Identify, assess, manage, mitigate, and report risks associated with outsourcing.** This includes meeting the institution’s financial service obligations to depositors, policyholders, and stakeholders.
* **Develop procedures to ensure that relevant business units are aware of the process, controls, monitoring, and compliance with the outsourcing policy.**
* **Establish procedures for monitoring the performance of outsourcing agreements on a continuing basis.** This includes addressing the renewal process for outsourcing agreements and developing contingency plans for bringing the outsourced business activity in-house if necessary.
* **Ensure that outsourcing risks are taken into account as part of the institution's risk management strategy.** This involves completing the risk management declaration required by APRA for outsourcing.
* **Advise APRA of any significant problems that could materially affect the outsourcing arrangement, or have consequences that materially affect the business operation, profitability, or reputation of the institution.** This also applies if the outsourcing agreement is terminated.
* **Ensure that the institution's internal audit function regularly reviews the proposed outsourcing of material business activities and reports to the board and board audit committee on compliance with the institution's outsourcing policy.**

APRA may also request external auditors or appropriate external experts to provide assessments of the risk management processes in place with respect to outsourcing arrangements."
28,"What are the requirements for business continuity planning under CPS 232, and how must banks demonstrate resilience to operational disruptions?","Under CPS 232, an APRA-regulated entity must identify, assess, manage, mitigate and report on potential business continuity risks to ensure that it can meet its financial and service obligations.","According to the provided context, **CPS 232** sets forth several requirements for business continuity planning (BCP) by APRA-regulated institutions, which include:

* **Business Continuity Management (BCM) Policy:** The institution must have a board-approved BCM policy that is up-to-date, documented, and clearly outlines the objective, approach, roles, responsibilities, and authorities related to BCM.
* **Business Impact Analysis (BIA):** The institution must conduct a BIA that identifies critical business functions, resources, and infrastructure and assesses the impact of disruptions. This must include considering plausible disruption scenarios with varying time periods, the extent of disruption to critical business operations, and the potential material impact on depositors, policyholders, and the institution's financial, legal, regulatory, and reputational standing.
* **Recovery Objective Strategy:** The institution must identify and document appropriate recovery objectives and implementation strategies based on the results of the BIA. These objectives should define the pre-defined goal of recovering critical business operations to a specified level of service and recovery level within a defined period of recovery time following a disruption.
* **Business Continuity Plan (BCP):** The institution must maintain a documented BCP that aligns with its BCM policy and meets its objectives. The BCP should include documented procedures and information to manage initial business disruptions, crisis management, and recover critical business operations. It must reflect the institution's specific requirements, identify critical business operations, recovery levels, time targets, and recovery strategies, as well as outlining the infrastructure and resources needed to implement the BCP.
* **Communication Plan:** The BCP must include a communication plan for staff and external stakeholders related to material business activities, including outsourced services. The institution must ensure the adequacy of the outsourced service provider's BCP and address dependencies between BCPS.
* **Review and Testing:** The institution must review and test its BCP at least annually, or more frequently if there are material changes to business operations, to ensure it meets BCM objectives. The results of testing must be formally reported to the board or delegated management, and the BCP must be updated to address any shortcomings identified during the review and testing process.
* **Notification Requirement:** The institution must notify APRA as soon as possible, and no later than 24 hours, if it experiences a major disruption that could have a material impact on its risk profile and financial soundness. The notification must include the nature of the disruption, actions taken, the likely effect on the institution's business operations, and the timeframe for returning to normal operations. The institution must also notify APRA once normal operations resume.

To demonstrate **resilience to operational disruptions**, APRA-regulated institutions must:

* **Establish Tolerance Levels:** For each critical operation, the institution must establish a tolerance level, defining the maximum period of time it can tolerate a disruption, the maximum data loss it can accept, and the minimum service level it must maintain while operating under alternative arrangements.
* **Include Tolerance Levels in the BCP:** The BCP must include a register of critical operations with associated tolerance levels, triggers that identify disruptions, and prompt activation plans. It must also detail the actions that will be taken to maintain critical operations within the established tolerance levels during a disruption.
* **Assess and Manage Execution Risk:** The BCP must include a thorough assessment of the risks associated with executing the plan, and outline the resources, preparatory measures, and dependencies required for effective implementation. This includes identifying key internal and external dependencies needed to support the BCP's implementation. 
* **Develop a Communication Strategy:** The BCP must include a communication strategy that supports the plan's execution.
* **Maintain Capability:** The institution must maintain the capability to execute the BCP, including access to the people, resources, and technology necessary to support the plan's implementation.
* **Monitor Compliance:** The institution must monitor compliance with tolerance levels, report any failures to meet those levels, and develop remediation plans for any deficiencies.
* **Conduct Systematic Testing:** The institution must have a systematic testing program for its BCP that covers all critical operations, including annual business continuity exercises. This program must test the effectiveness of the BCP and the institution's ability to meet tolerance levels across a range of severe and plausible scenarios. The testing program must be tailored to the institution's material risks and include a range of scenarios, such as disruptions to services provided by material service providers. APRA may require the inclusion of APRA-determined scenarios in business continuity exercises. 
* **Update BCP Annually:** The institution must update its BCP annually to reflect changes in legal and organizational structures, business mix, strategy, risk profile, and any shortcomings identified during review and testing. The internal audit function must periodically review the BCP and provide assurance to the board that it is a credible plan that will allow the institution to maintain critical operations within tolerance levels during severe disruptions.  

By adhering to these requirements and demonstrating the capacity to implement effective BCPs, banks can ensure their resilience to operational disruptions and maintain the stability of the financial system."
29,What are the obligations for banks under CPS 234 regarding the protection of information assets and managing cyber security risks?,"Under CPS 234, APRA-regulated entities must implement information security controls to protect information assets, including those managed by related or third-parties, in a timely manner and commensurate with: Existing and emerging vulnerabilities and threats to critical and sensitive information assets.","CPS 234 outlines the requirements for APRA-regulated entities, including banks, to establish and maintain an Information Security Policy Framework that is commensurate with the exposure, vulnerability, and threat to their information assets. This framework should provide direction, responsibility, and obligations for maintaining information security.

**Key Obligations:**

* **Information Asset Identification and Classification:** Banks must classify their information assets, including those managed by related parties and third parties, according to their criticality and sensitivity. This classification should reflect the potential impact of a cyber security incident on the financial and non-financial interests of the entity, depositors, policyholders, beneficiaries, and customers.
* **Implementation of Controls:** Banks must implement information security controls to protect their information assets, including those managed by related parties and third parties. These controls should be implemented in a timely manner and commensurate with the vulnerability and threat to the information asset, its criticality and sensitivity, its stage within its lifecycle, and the potential consequence of a cyber security incident.
* **Evaluation of Control Design:** Banks must evaluate the design of information security controls to ensure that they effectively protect information assets.
* **Incident Management:** Banks must have a robust mechanism in place to detect and respond to cyber security incidents in a timely manner. They must also maintain a plan to respond to cyber security incidents that could plausibly occur. This plan should include mechanisms for managing the relevant stages of incident detection, post-incident review, escalation, and reporting.
* **Testing of Controls:** Banks must annually review and test their information security response plan to ensure it remains effective and fit-for-purpose. They must also conduct systematic testing of the effectiveness of information security controls, with the frequency and nature of testing commensurate with the rate of vulnerability and threat, changes to the criticality and sensitivity of information assets, the potential consequences of a cyber security incident, and the risk associated with the exposure environment.
* **Reporting of Control Deficiencies:** Banks must assess the nature and frequency of control testing to ensure it is commensurate with the information asset. They must escalate and report to the board and senior management any control deficiencies identified during testing, and ensure these deficiencies are remediated in a timely manner.
* **Testing by Specialists:** Banks must ensure that testing is conducted by appropriately skilled and functionally independent specialists.
* **Internal Audit:** Banks must conduct an internal audit activity that includes a review of the design and operating effectiveness of information security controls, including those maintained by related parties and third parties. 
* **APRA Notification:** Banks must notify APRA as soon as possible, and no later than one hour, after becoming aware of a cyber security incident that has materially affected, or has the potential to materially affect, the financial or non-financial interests of the entity, depositors, policyholders, beneficiaries, and customers. They must also notify APRA as soon as possible, and no later than the next business day, after becoming aware of a material information security control weakness that the entity expects to be able to remediate in a timely manner.

**In summary, CPS 234 places a strong emphasis on banks having robust information security measures in place, including:**

* A comprehensive understanding of their information assets and the risks they face
* A well-defined and effective information security policy framework
* Timely implementation of controls commensurate with the assessed risks
* A robust incident management process
* Ongoing monitoring and testing of controls
* A clear escalation and reporting process for any control deficiencies identified
* A commitment to ensuring that the information security program is managed by appropriately skilled and independent specialists."
30,What is the CPS 510 governance standard?,"This standard requires an entity to have a sound governance framework and to conduct its affairs with a high degree of integrity. Entities must meet specific requirements for board committees, appointments, renewal and performance. This is a core standard in the Governance Pillar.",The provided text does not contain information regarding CPS 510.
31,What is a responsible person in APRA?,"Persons who are responsible for the management and oversight of an APRA-regulated entity need to have appropriate skills, experience and knowledge and act with honesty and integrity. These skills and qualities strengthen the protection afforded to depositors, policyholders and/or other stakeholders.","A responsible person, under APRA guidelines, is an individual whose activities could materially affect, either directly or indirectly, the whole or a substantial part of an APRA-regulated institution’s business or financial standing. This includes, but is not limited to:

* **Directors**
* **Officers**
* **Appointed Auditors**
* **Appointed Actuaries**
* **People who perform activities in a subsidiary of an APRA-regulated institution** 
* **Employees**
* **Consultants**
* **Contractors**
* **Anyone else who plays a significant role in management or control of an APRA-regulated institution or group**

The definition of a responsible person is broad and includes anyone who has a material impact on the prudential matters of an APRA-regulated institution."
32,How must banks structure their remuneration practices under CPS 510 to align with risk management objectives?,CPS 510 54 The Remuneration Policys performance-based components of remuneration must be designed to encourage behaviour that supports: (a) the institutions long-term financial soundness; and (b) the risk management framework of the institution. (c) the risk management framework of the RSE licensee.,"CPS 510 outlines the requirements for remuneration practices at APRA-regulated entities, including banks. It emphasizes the importance of aligning remuneration structures with the entity's risk management objectives, promoting responsible risk-taking and sustainable performance.

Banks must design variable remuneration arrangements that are:

* **Aligned with risk management objectives:** Remuneration structures should reflect the financial and non-financial risks that could materially impact the bank's risk profile, sustainable performance, and long-term soundness.
* **Commensurate with risk performance outcomes:**  Payout and vesting schedules should be sensitive to the time horizon and the range of potential risk performance outcomes, allowing for appropriate adjustments based on risk performance.
* **Include appropriate variable remuneration adjustment tools:** This includes provisions for in-period adjustments (malus), clawback arrangements, and downward adjustments, ensuring that remuneration reflects both positive and negative risk outcomes. 
* **Support downward adjustments:** Clear triggers should be identified for making downward adjustments to remuneration, and the bank must clearly define the process for determining the appropriate adjustment tool and the amount of the downward adjustment.
* **Give material weight to non-financial measures:**  A significant proportion of remuneration should be tied to non-financial measures, reflecting the importance of responsible conduct and adherence to the bank's values and ethical standards.
* **Subject to malus and clawback arrangements:** Variable remuneration for senior managers, executive directors, and highly paid material risk-takers must be subject to malus and clawback arrangements, ensuring that individuals are held accountable for adverse risk outcomes.
* **Clearly defined criteria for remuneration adjustments:** Specific criteria should be outlined for applying variable remuneration adjustment tools, including misconduct, significant adverse outcomes, and breaches of compliance obligations.
* **Proportionate to the severity of risk outcomes:**  The total downward adjustment of variable remuneration must be proportionate to the severity of the risk or conduct outcome. 
* **Vesting tied to investigation closure:**  Variable remuneration must be vested only when relevant investigations are closed.
* **Conflict of interest mitigation:** The bank must take appropriate steps to assess and mitigate conflicts of interest in remuneration arrangements.
* **Deferral of variable remuneration:**  The bank must defer variable remuneration for CEOs, senior managers, and executive directors, with a minimum deferral period of four to six years.

By implementing these provisions, banks can ensure that remuneration structures are aligned with risk management objectives, incentivizing responsible risk-taking and promoting a strong risk culture."
33,What is risk culture assessment?,"The Risk Culture Assessment report aggregates information gained during each step. The report provides (i) maturity levels for each Risk Culture attribute, (ii) improvement opportunities identified, and (iii) mitigation actions formulated as recommendations (see Examples).","The provided text does not specifically define ""risk culture assessment."" However, it does discuss the importance of instilling an appropriate risk culture across an institution's business plan. 

The text states that an APRA-regulated institution must identify desirable changes to risk culture and take steps to address those changes. This suggests that risk culture is a key consideration for institutions and that they must actively monitor and manage it. 

Based on this, we can infer that a **risk culture assessment** would likely involve evaluating the extent to which an institution's culture supports its ability to operate consistently within its risk appetite.  This would involve examining aspects like:

* **Risk awareness:** How well do employees understand the institution's risk appetite and risk management framework?
* **Risk tolerance:**  Do employees feel comfortable taking calculated risks within the institution's defined limits?
* **Risk reporting:** Are risk issues and concerns effectively communicated and escalated within the organization?
* **Risk accountability:** Is there a clear understanding of individual and team responsibilities for risk management?
* **Rewarding and recognizing risk-taking:** Are employees encouraged to take responsible risks?

A risk culture assessment would likely involve various methods, including:

* **Surveys:**  Asking employees about their perceptions of risk and the institution's risk culture.
* **Interviews:** Gathering qualitative data about employees' experiences with risk management.
* **Observations:**  Assessing how employees behave in relation to risk in their daily work.
* **Review of internal documents:** Examining policies, procedures, and communication materials related to risk management. 

By assessing their risk culture, institutions can identify areas for improvement and implement strategies to foster a culture that supports sound and prudent risk management practices."
34,What is CPS 230?,"What is CPS 230?

35,When should I first contact APRA,"Once you have developed an early stage business plan it can be beneficial to have a meeting with APRA. At this meeting APRA can provide high level views of any likely challenges with your proposals, allowing you to make adjustments to ensure your business develops in a way that is most likely to result in a successful application. APRA will also be able to provide advice about APRAÃs prudential requirements and expectations and answer any questions you have about what to expect in the licensing process. ÃÃ",The provided text does not contain information on when to first contact APRA.
36,If I am applying for an ARPA licence will I need any other tyoe of licence,"It is likely that you will need to be licenced by ASIC. You may also need to seek authorisation or to register with other regulators, such as the RBA and AUSTRAC. You should allow time for their assessment processes.","The provided text does not contain information about the licensing process for an APRA licence, therefore, it is impossible to determine if you will need any other licenses to apply for an APRA licence."
37,I want to register a company name with an APRA regulate restricted term. How do I do this?,"Once you have lodged your application with APRA you should advise APRA in writing of the specific company name that you want to register and request APRAÃs consent if the name includes an APRA regulated restricted term. APRA regulated restricted terms include the words ÃbankÃ, ÃbankerÃ, ÃbankingÃ, Ãbuilding societyÃ, Ãcredit unionÃ, Ãcredit societyÃ and Ãfriendly societyÃ. If you want to register a company name that uses the restricted words in section 66 of the Banking Act 1959 (such as the words ÃbankÃ, ÃbankerÃ and ÃbankingÃ), please also refer to the APRAÃs Restricted Words under the Banking Act 1959 Guidelines: If consent is granted by APRA, it will usually be subject to conditions, such as not using the company name publicly prior to licensing. It is an offence for a person to use a restricted word or expression under section 66 in relation to a financial business, except where APRA has granted a consent or exemption, or where a statutory exception applies.

If you want to register a company name that uses the restricted term Ãfriendly societyÃ you will need to apply for consent from APRA under section 16E of the Life Insurance Act 1995.  It is an offence for a person to use the restricted expression Ãfriendly societyÃ in relation to a financial business, except where APRA has granted a consent or determined that section 16E does not apply to that person. ",This document does not contain any information about the process of registering a company name that includes an APRA regulated restricted term.
38,Can APRA provide further guidance beyond CPS and GPG220 Risk Management as to what should be included in the Risk Appetite Statement (RAS)?,"What is a RAS?The RAS is a document that provides boundaries within which both management and staff know how it is acceptable to operate. It provides ground rules which should be very clear for management in terms of what they are, and are not, allowed to do in pursuit of the institutionÃs business strategy and objectives. Without such boundaries and ground rules, management (and ultimately all staff) may be unaware that they are operating outside of the risk appetite set by the Board.Ã How should the RAS be structured? APRA does not prescribe the structure or form of your RAS and you are generally free to adopt a risk appetite that suits the particular circumstances of your business, within the requirements of the prudential standards.A RAS should be a concise document and should not include all management reporting. It is unlikely that a RAS would need to have an appendix as it would not be expected that there would be ancillary information in a RAS.  What content should be covered in the RAS? The RAS should cover both high-level qualitative statements and, where appropriate, quantitative measures, which combined clearly capture your attitude towards, and level of acceptance of, its different risks. The RAS should consider the material risks to your company as well as to your reputation with policyholders/depositors, investors and customers. The RAS should also closely align with your strategic direction.Qualitative statements should set the overall tone for your approach to risk taking and should also clearly articulate the BoardÃs motivations for taking on or avoiding certain types of risks or exposures. In this way, qualitative statements advise stakeholders of your attitude toward risk taking by placing high-level boundaries around the types of activities you are prepared to undertake.Qualitative statements are likely where a hard boundary for operations is being set rather than a metric with variables or a scale.How do we demonstrate that the RAS has/will be applied? Your business strategy and policies should operate in line with your RAS. Once the Board has approved your RAS, you should be able to evidence decisions being made in line with it.Additionally, as the RAS needs to be used by a number of stakeholders consistently across all of your business operations it must be easy to communicate and written in plain English. A RAS which is not easily understood will be difficult to embed throughout your organisation, as staff will not know how they are expected to behave and what they are permitted to do in order to operate within the risk appetite.Ã*ÃInformation contained in this section is a summary of all information available from APRA including Information Papers, letters to industry and speeches. The questions and answers are designed to clarify CPS 220 Risk Management but do not form part of the law or create enforceable requirements. If there is a conflict between the guidance contained in this FAQ and CPS 220 Risk Management, then the requirements of CPS 220 Risk Management prevail.",The provided text does not contain information on APRA's guidance for a Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) beyond the requirements outlined in CPS and GPG220 Risk Management.
39,What is required in the external auditor's verification of minimum captial?,"APRA requires the applicant to provide written verification from its appointed external auditor that it meets the minimum regulatory capital level required prior to licensing. This must include meeting the applicable minimum level of capital and capital ratios. The written verification should set out the steps taken by the external auditor in making the verification, including the calculation of minimum capital requirements where applicable. For life insurers, the verification should address the solvency of each statutory fund, as well as the minimum capital requirements and capital ratios for each of its statutory funds and the life company as a whole. RSE applicants are required to attach an audited copy of the applicantÃs statement of financial position for the last two years to their applications, but do not need a separate verification of solvency.

43,How should securitisation  warehouse funding risks be addressed?,"Start-up ADIs are often reliant on securitisation warehouse facilities to quickly build lending volumes. For start-up ADIs reliant on securitisation warehouse facilities (e.g. greater than 20 per cent of funding in any projected year), APRA expects the warehouse facility to be automatically placed into amortisation if the warehouse facility is not renewed.  Where this occurs, this will be considered long-term wholesale funding and will not add to the minimum MLH requirement. This approach reduces the risk that the reliance on warehouse facilities would result in a situation where the new ADI either has to transfer the mortgages to the warehouse provider, who may replace the new ADI as servicer or sell the mortgages to another party, or take the assets back on balance sheet at the end of the contractual term if the facility is not renewed. These scenarios would likely threaten the viability of the start-up ADI, as it is unlikely to have sufficient funding to repay the facility, and loss of mortgages will eliminate servicing income and retained equity in the warehoused mortgages.

44,Is there a minimum expectation in regard to operating captial at the point of licensing?,"Yes, in addition to the expectation that Restricted ADIs must hold capital of at least $3 million plus a resolution reserve (typically $1 million), APRA expects a Restricted ADI to have sufficient operating capital to enable the entity to cover expenses and planned lending for typically the first three months after licensing. This may vary where appropriate, for example where an applicant has a profitable existing business. This operating capital would reduce the pressure on Restricted ADIs to raise money immediately after licensing and help ensure that the Restricted ADI has the resources it needs to operationalise during the restricted period. ",The provided context does not contain any information about minimum operating capital requirements at the point of licensing.
45,Are Restricted ADIs required to conduct some elements of banking business during the restricted phase?,"Yes, Restricted ADIs are expected to carry out some elements of banking business (i.e. at least one deposit or lending product) during the restricted phase. The Information Paper states on page 22 that APRA expects Restricted ADIs to be conducting limited business during the restricted phase. APRA strongly re-inforces this expectation. This will result in significant benefits to both the applicant and APRA, as set out below: -ensures the Restricted ADI is building both staff and operational capabilities during the restricted phase; -provides the Restricted ADI with an opportunity to test its business proposition with customers; -demonstrates to investors and potential investors that the applicant can launch a product and attract customers, which should assist the applicant in raising capital; and -allows APRA to assess the ability of the Restricted ADI to launch and manage products, providing a more informed assessment of risk management capabilities.",The provided text does not contain information on whether restricted ADIs are required to conduct some elements of banking business during the restricted phase.
46,Does my entity need to comply with all of the Prudential Standards?,"Yes, your entity will need to comply with all of the applicable Prudential Standards. You should complete self-assessments against the requirements of the Prudential Standards. A self-assessment consists of a paragraph by paragraph review of the requirements of the prudential standard and cross references the relevant clause in your policies or otherwise contains an explanation as to why a requirement is not applicable. The purpose of the self-assessment is to enable management and the Board to gain comfort that the entity will meet the requirements or alternatively highlight areas of non-compliance that may lead to further discussions with APRA. APRA may ask to see your self-assessments. In the event that your entity is unable to meet a prudential requirement, there may be exceptional circumstances where APRA will consider a request to adjust or exclude a requirement, for example where the proposed business model is substantially different to existing models and it is not possible under this business model to comply with the requirement. You should be aware that a request to adjust or exclude a requirement of the Prudential Standard will likely add further time to the licence application due to the need to consider the proposal, including the impact on desired prudential outcomes and the precedent it would set. A request for an adjustment or exclusion of a requirement may not be approved. You should factor in time for the review of any request and have a contingency plan if the request is not granted.","The provided text does not contain information that states whether an entity needs to comply with all of the Prudential Standards. It only mentions that an entity may be required to comply with specific Prudential Standards depending on its activities and classifications, such as being a ""Significant Financial Institution"" (SFI) or a ""Non-Significant Financial Institution"" (NSFI)."
47,What is APRA's role in reviewing policies/documents?,"APRA reviews documents to assess adherence to and understanding of prudential standards, as well as to obtain a view in regard to the competency of your staff. APRA does not approve the individual policies, as ensuring the policies are suitable for your entity is the responsibility of the Board and management. APRA will seek to ensure that the policies meet the necessary prudential requirements and that APRA has confidence that they can be implemented effectively ahead of granting a licence.","APRA reviews policies and documents for **prudential supervision** purposes, which means ensuring the safety and soundness of financial institutions. This involves reviewing policies and documents to: 

* **Assess compliance with prudential standards:**  APRA sets prudential standards, which are rules and guidelines that financial institutions must follow. 
* **Identify potential risks:**  APRA reviews documents to identify risks to financial institutions and the financial system as a whole. 
* **Monitor the effectiveness of risk management:** APRA examines policies to ensure that financial institutions have effective risk management practices in place. 

APRA may also review policies and documents for **statistical and policy purposes**, such as: 

* **Compiling national accounts:** APRA uses information from financial institutions to compile national accounts, which are a measure of the country's economic activity. 
* **Formulating policy:** APRA uses data from financial institutions to inform its policy decisions. 

APRA's role in reviewing policies and documents is essential for maintaining the stability of the Australian financial system."
48,What does APRA do?,"The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is the prudential regulator of the financial services industry. It oversees banks, mutuals, general insurance and reinsurance companies, life insurance, private health insurers, friendly societies, and most members of the superannuation industry.

Its primary functions include Regulation and Supervision, Financial Stability, Consumer Protection, Prudential Standards, and Crisis Management.","APRA, or the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, is established under the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act. APRA is responsible for the prudential supervision of:

* **Authorised Deposit-taking Institutions (ADIs)**, which are defined within the Banking Act
* **Registered Financial Corporations (RFCs)**, which are defined within the Financial Sector Collection Data Act 
* **Authorised Non-Operating Holding Companies (NOHCs)**, as defined within the Banking Act
* **Insurers**
* **Superannuation Funds**

APRA's primary goal is to ensure the **prudential supervision** of these entities, which means that they are **financially sound and can meet their obligations to their customers**. 

APRA achieves this through a variety of means, including:

* **Setting prudential standards**
* **Collecting data and statistics**
* **Conducting audits and reviews**
* **Issuing guidelines and instructions**
* **Granting approvals and authorisations**
* **Taking enforcement action when necessary**

APRA also has a role in **policy development** and **research**, and it works closely with other regulatory bodies in Australia and internationally."
49,How does APRA regulate bank lending safety?,"APRA alsoÃundertakes regular reviews and assessments of regulated entities. If APRA identifies any risks during the supervision process, it will intervene early to find a solution before an entity's ability to meet its financial obligations to its customers is threatened.","APRA regulates bank lending safety in a number of ways, as outlined in the provided text. 

* **Lending Limits:** APRA sets limits on certain types of lending, such as lending to borrowers with a debt-to-income ratio greater than four or six times, lending with a loan-to-valuation ratio greater than 80% or 90%, investment lending, and interest-only lending. This helps to prevent excessive risk from being generated at the system level.
* **Credit Risk Management:** APRA evaluates a bank's credit risk management policies, processes, and practices. If they are found to be deficient, the bank may be required to make changes, increase provisioning, write off loans, or even increase their capital adequacy.
* **Collateral Valuation:** APRA requires banks to accurately identify and document the asset serving as collateral for loans. The value of collateral must be appropriately determined and reviewed on an ongoing basis.
* **Securitisation:**  APRA sets requirements for securitisation, which is the process of packaging and selling loans to investors. This includes requirements for operational risk, regulatory capital relief, and risk transfer. 
* **Large Exposure Limits:**  APRA establishes limits on the amount of lending a bank can make to any one borrower or group of connected borrowers. 
* **Data Reporting:** Banks must provide APRA with detailed data on their lending activities. This data is used for prudential supervision, including monitoring credit risk and capital adequacy.
* **Business Continuity Management:** Banks must have a robust business continuity management framework that ensures they can continue to operate in the event of a major disruption.
* **Risk Management:**  APRA requires banks to have a comprehensive risk management framework that addresses all material risks, including credit risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk. 

Overall, APRA's approach to regulating bank lending safety is designed to ensure that banks are lending responsibly and are not taking on excessive risk. This helps to protect depositors, borrowers, and the financial system as a whole."

APRA also regulates life companies, including friendly societies, and eligible foreign life insurance companies (EFLICs), and their registered non-operating holding companies."
69,What Is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)?,The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) refers to the proportion of highly liquid assets that financial institutions must hold to ensure that they can meet their short-term obligations and ride out any disruptions in the market. It is mandated by international banking agreements known as the Basel Accords.,"The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is a prudential standard that ensures an Authorised Deposit-taking Institution (ADI) has enough high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to cover its net cash outflows over a 30-day time period during a severe liquidity stress scenario.  

The LCR has two components:

* **Numerator:** The value of the stock of liquid assets held by the ADI under stressed conditions.
* **Denominator:** The total net cash outflow calculated according to the scenario parameters set out in the prudential standard.

The LCR must be at least 100% which means the ADI must have enough liquid assets to cover 100% of its net cash outflows over the 30-day period."

76,What are APRAs stress testing requirements for banks?,"The starting point in developing a stress test is to design the scenarios. This is the foundation of the exercise, and it is important that scenarios are calibrated effectively and are well targeted. For industry stress tests, APRA collaborates with both the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) on the design of scenarios and the economic parameters that define them. In 2017, APRA also engaged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in the design of the operational risk scenario.

Scenarios should be aligned to the purpose of the exercise. At a high level, these are guided within APRA by several objectives  namely to:

assess system-wide and entity-specific resilience to severe but plausible scenarios;
improve stress testing capabilities across the industry; and
support the identification and assessment of core and emerging risks.
In line with these objectives, APRA developed two scenarios for the 2017 industry stress test. The first was a macroeconomic scenario with a China-led recession in Australia and New Zealand. This was considered the most severe but plausible adverse economic scenario for the banking system at the time.[1] In this scenario, there was assumed to be a fall in Australian GDP of 4 per cent, while house prices declined 35 per cent nationally over three years. The chart below provides an indication of the severity of the scenario: it shows that the assumed peak unemployment rate in the scenario was similar to the 1990s recession in Australia, the United States experience in the global financial crisis (GFC), as well as recent overseas regulatory stress tests.","APRA requires banks to undertake regular portfolio level risk specific stress testing to assess credit risk exposure in stressed conditions. This stress testing must take into account the nature and scale of the bank’s credit portfolio and must be conducted at a granular level to enable sensitivity analysis of risk characteristics across different exposure types. Stress testing scenarios must include severe and plausible adverse conditions. The analysis must include contingency plans regarding actions the board and senior management may take in response to certain scenarios. The bank’s stress testing arrangements must be well documented and include sound policies and processes governing the stress testing program, including timely communication of information, scenarios, key assumptions, results, and capital impacts. The board and senior management must independently validate and check the stress testing model."
77,What is RWA?,"Risk-weighted asset is a bank's assets or off-balance-sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. This sort of asset calculation is used in determining the capital requirement or Capital Adequacy Ratio for a financial institution.","RWA stands for **Risk-Weighted Asset**.  

This term is used in the context of calculating the regulatory capital requirement for a financial institution. It refers to the amount of capital that an institution must hold to cover potential losses from its credit risk."
