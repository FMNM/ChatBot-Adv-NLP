    "# Chatbot QA for APRA regulatory data\n",
    "The aim of the QA chat is to experiment various techniques for accuracy in answering questions from a private corpus of data. The pipeline starts with reading the documents from the dataset in docx file format located in ./dataset/word_standards. The document data is then divided into smaller chunks for embedding. The embeddings are then stored into the Pinecone vectord database hosted on the cloud. The document embeddings are generated using Cohere from Bedrock. For answer generation, OoenAI is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Design architecture](architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Techniques of embedding\n",
    "The documents are divided into smaller chunks due to resource limitation of the current technology standards. Accuracy is important when it comes to regulations. So the balance of embedding size or number of chunks is considered with the balance of accuracy, retrieval latency and compute resources with the number of documents provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preserve relevant context\n",
    "When documents are divided into chunks, it also loses context. And context is very important in retrieval. To preserve relevancy, chunking for each document has the longest charactor length and overlapping. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Prevent context cross contamination\n",
    "To ensure precisision, preverving relevant context within the same document is important. Chunking is done by invidual document to prevent text overlapping with another documents, which will contain different regulation data. Cross contaminating data will lead to inaccuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AWS Bedrock \n",
    "Cohere is used for dense vector embedding on all the documents before storing into the vector database. Claude is used for generation. Usuing AWS Bedrock provides the performance and flexibility to change foundation models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vector store\n",
    "Pinecone is a cloud based vector store. The embeddings generated from the documents are stored as one-off tasks. This embedding is later retrieved to generate answers based on queries. Cloud vector database provides the performance when it comes go vector search. Cloud service is used for scalability and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieval and generation\n",
    "Based on a query, search on vectors is performed using cosine similarity between query and database vectors. OpenAI is used for prompting and answer generation based on retrievals from Pinecone vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SET UP\n",
    "Before running this file, please run <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>. To use various cloude services, following accounts need to be set up to obtain access keys. The following keys are needed in the .env file locatedin the same directory as this notebook.\n",

      "Answer:  An Australian Deposit-Taking Institution (DTI) is a financial institution that is authorized to accept deposits from customers and provide banking services, such as loans and credit cards. On the other hand, a Non-Deposit Taking Institution (NDTI) is a financial institution that is not authorized to accept deposits from customers, but can still provide other financial services such as investment management and insurance.\n",

      "Question: How do Australian banks report their exposure to credit risk using the Internal Ratings-Based Approach (IRB)?\n",
      "Answer:  Australian banks report their exposure to credit risk using the Internal Ratings-Based Approach (IRB) by using a standardized set of risk categories and credit ratings to assess the creditworthiness of their borrowers. This approach allows banks to calculate their own risk-weighted assets and determine the amount of capital they need to hold to cover potential losses from credit risk.\n",

This ratio is calculated by dividing a bank's high-quality liquid assets by its total net cash outflows over a 30-day period. The purpose of the LCR is to ensure that banks have enough liquid assets to withstand potential liquidity shocks and maintain their operations. \n",

Other important elements may include establishing a risk appetite and tolerance, conducting stress tests and scenario analyses, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.\n",

      "Answer:  Operational risk refers to the potential losses that a financial institution may face due to inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events. Under Australian prudential regulations, financial institutions are required to have robust risk management frameworks in place to identify, assess, and mitigate operational risks. This includes having effective internal controls, risk monitoring and reporting systems, and contingency plans in case of unexpected events. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in penalties and sanctions from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).\n",

      "Question: How do Australian banks report their exposure to liquidity risk using the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)?\n",
      "Answer:  Australian banks report their exposure to liquidity risk using the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) by calculating and reporting their LCR on a monthly basis to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA). This calculation takes into account the bank's high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) and its net cash outflows over a 30-day period, and the resulting ratio must be at least 100%. This information is then disclosed in the bank's financial statements and is also publicly available on APRA's website.\n",
      "\n",
      "12\n",
      "Question: Can you explain the concept of Credit Risk Management under Australian prudential regulations?\n",
      "Answer:  Credit risk management refers to the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling potential risks associated with lending money to borrowers. In Australia, prudential regulations require banks and other financial institutions to have robust credit risk management practices in place to ensure the safety and stability of the financial system. This includes setting appropriate risk limits, conducting thorough credit assessments, and regularly monitoring and reviewing credit portfolios. The goal of credit risk management is to minimize the likelihood of default and financial losses, while also promoting responsible lending practices.\n",

      "\n",
      "14\n",
      "Question: How do Australian banks calculate their risk-weighted assets (RWA) under Basel III?\n",
      "Answer:  Australian banks calculate their risk-weighted assets (RWA) under Basel III by assigning a risk weight to each asset based on its credit risk. This risk weight is determined by the type of asset and the credit rating of the borrower. The total RWA is then calculated by multiplying the risk weight by the value of the asset. This calculation is used to determine the minimum capital requirements for banks under Basel III regulations.\n",
      "\n",
      "15\n",
      "Question: Can you explain the concept of Systemic Risk under Australian prudential regulations?\n",
      "Answer:  Systemic risk refers to the risk of a widespread financial crisis or collapse of the financial system, caused by the failure of one or more financial institutions. Under Australian prudential regulations, systemic risk is managed through various measures such as stress testing, capital requirements, and risk management frameworks to ensure the stability and resilience of the financial system. The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) closely monitors and assesses the potential systemic risks in the banking sector and takes necessary actions to mitigate them.\n",

      "Question: Can you explain the concept of Liquidity Risk under Australian prudential regulations?\n",
      "Answer:  Liquidity risk refers to the potential for a bank or financial institution to be unable to meet its financial obligations due to a lack of available funds. Under Australian prudential regulations, banks are required to maintain a certain level of liquidity to ensure they can meet their financial obligations, such as customer withdrawals or loan repayments. This is to protect depositors and maintain stability in the financial system. Banks must also have contingency plans in place to manage liquidity risk in case of unexpected events.\n",
